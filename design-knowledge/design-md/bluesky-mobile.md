# Design System Inspiration of Bluesky (iOS)

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

Bluesky's iOS app is a clean, friendly, sky-bright timeline that feels open and uncluttered. The default light surface is pure white (`#FFFFFF`) with near-black text (`#0B0F14`), and it offers two darker variants: a soft "Dim" mode on a desaturated slate (`#1E2936`) and a deep "Dark" mode (`#0B0F14`). The triple-theme choice is a deliberate accessibility-and-comfort gesture — Bluesky wants you to pick the brightness that suits your eyes, not impose one. Across all three, the timeline is a quiet column of skeet cards separated by hairline dividers, with content given room to breathe.

The accent system is anchored by Bluesky Blue (`#1185FE`) — a confident, slightly electric sky-blue used for links, the active tab, the compose FAB, primary buttons, and the butterfly logomark. Its pressed state deepens to `#0F6FD6`. The single most expressive interaction is the like: a heart that does a springy pop-scale (and a small color fill to the same blue family) when tapped — light, joyful, and instantly legible. The other signature is structural rather than chromatic: a row of pinned, switchable custom-feed tabs at the very top of Home ("Following", "Discover", and any algorithmic feeds you've pinned), making the feed itself a first-class, user-controlled object.

Typography is the system font (San Francisco) at comfortable reading sizes, mapped to an Inter fallback for cross-platform parity. Skeet bodies sit at 15pt with generous line height; display names are 15pt semibold; handles (`@user.bsky.social`) are 14pt in muted gray. The butterfly logo and the pinned-feed selector are the two identity anchors a user sees first. There are no heavy shadows, no skeuomorphism — just clean type, a single bright accent, and a layout that makes the user's choice of feed and theme the center of the experience.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Triple theme: Light `#FFFFFF` / Dim `#1E2936` / Dark `#0B0F14` — user picks comfort level
- Bluesky Blue (`#1185FE`) for links, active tab, compose FAB, primary actions, butterfly logo
- Like = heart pop-scale spring — the joyful signature gesture
- Pinned custom-feed selector tabs at the top of Home — the feed is user-controlled
- Skeet card action row: Reply · Repost · Like · Share, evenly spaced
- Reply-controls chip on the composer (who can reply)
- Butterfly logomark as the brand anchor
- System font at reading sizes (15pt body), Inter fallback
- Bottom tabs (Home / Search / Notifications / Chat / Profile) + compose FAB

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Primary
- **Bluesky Blue** (`#1185FE`): Links, active tab tint, compose FAB, primary button fill, butterfly logo, mentions/hashtags.
- **Blue Pressed** (`#0F6FD6`): Active/pressed state for blue CTAs and the FAB.

- **Success Green** (`#2DBE85`): Posted/confirmed, follow-confirmed.
- **Warning Amber** (`#F5A623`): Content-label warnings, rate limits.

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family
- **Primary**: `SF Pro Text` / `SF Pro Display` (system) on iOS
- **Cross-platform parity**: `Inter` (web/Android reference)
- **Fallback Stack**: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Inter', 'SF Pro Text', 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`
- **Monospace**: `ui-monospace, 'SF Mono', Menlo, monospace`

### Hierarchy

| Role | Font | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Screen Title (Large) | SF Pro Display | 28pt | 700 | 1.2 | -0.4pt | "Notifications", "Search" large nav title |
| Section Header | SF Pro Display | 21pt | 700 | 1.2 | -0.3pt | "Suggested for you", profile sections |
| Display Name | SF Pro Text | 15pt | 600 | 1.25 | -0.1pt | Poster's display name on a skeet |
| Skeet Body | SF Pro Text | 15pt | 400 | 1.4 | 0pt | The post text |
| Body (Settings) | SF Pro Text | 15pt | 400 | 1.4 | 0pt | Settings descriptions |
| Handle / Meta | SF Pro Text | 14pt | 400 | 1.3 | 0pt | `@user.bsky.social`, "2h", reply context |
| Feed Tab Label | SF Pro Text | 15pt | 600 | 1.2 | -0.1pt | "Following", "Discover" pinned-feed tabs |
| Action Count | SF Pro Text | 13pt | 500 | 1.2 | 0pt | Reply/repost/like numeric counts |
| Button (Primary) | SF Pro Text | 15pt | 600 | 1.0 | -0.1pt | "Post", "Follow" |
| Button (Secondary) | SF Pro Text | 14pt | 600 | 1.0 | 0pt | "Following", outline actions |
| Tab Label | SF Pro Text | 10pt | 600 | 1.0 | 0.1pt | Bottom tab bar labels |
| Reply Context | SF Pro Text | 13pt | 400 | 1.3 | 0pt | "Reply to @name" line above a skeet |

### Principles
- **Comfortable body at 15pt / 1.4**: readable without being heavy — Bluesky is conversational
- **Handle always visible**: `@user.bsky.social` is a 14pt structural element
- **Weight at 400 / 500 / 600 / 700**: regular body, medium counts, semibold names/feeds, bold titles
- **System font, Inter parity**: native iOS feel matching the web app's Inter rendering
- **Blue text only for links/mentions/hashtags** — body text never uses the accent

- Blur-on-scroll background

### Input Fields

**Search Field**
- Background: `#F1F3F5` (light) / `#1E2936` (dim) / `#161E27` (dark)
- Height: 40pt, corner radius 500pt (pill)
- Leading `magnifyingglass` 16pt `#697787`
- Placeholder: "Search", 15pt w400 `#697787`
- Focus: 1.5pt `#1185FE` ring

**Compose Editor**
- Full-screen sheet, plain text area at 18pt w400
- Character ring counter (300 default) that turns `#E5484D` past the limit
- Toolbar: media, GIF, alt-text, language, and a **reply-controls chip** above the keyboard
- Reply-controls chip: "Everybody can reply" → tap to restrict (Mentioned / Followed) — turns `#1185FE` when restricted

### Distinctive Components

**Switchable Custom Feeds**
- The pinned-feed selector is the signature: the timeline is not one algorithm — it's a user-curated set of feeds you tab between, treating "the feed" as a first-class, swappable object

**Like Pop**
- Tapping the heart fills it pink `#EC4899` and pop-scales 1.0 → 1.25 → 1.0 over ~300ms with a spring; un-liking scales back to outline
- Paired with a light confirmation statevisible feedback state; the count rolls up by one

**Reply-Controls Chip**
- On the composer, an inline chip stating who can reply, echoing Bluesky's reply-gating model; blue when restricted — a visible consent control

**Butterfly Logomark**
- The brand anchor, rendered in `#1185FE`, used in the splash, the empty states, and the Home nav

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 4pt
- Scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 56
- Standard margin: 16pt horizontal on skeet cards
- Skeet vertical rhythm: 12pt top/bottom padding; cards separated by 1pt dividers

### Grid & Container
- Content width: full device width, 16pt internal padding
- Media grid: 1 image full-width 12pt radius; 2–4 in a 2-col 12pt-radius mosaic, 2pt gaps
- Link/quote embeds: full-width nested card, 12pt radius, 1pt border

### Whitespace Philosophy
- **Conversational, not dense**: 15pt body at 1.4 line height; cards have comfortable internal padding
- **Dividers, not boxes**: separation is a hairline — the timeline stays visually quiet
- **Feed selector is sticky**: the user's curated feeds are always one tap away at the top

### Border Radius Scale
- Square (0pt): Full-bleed banners only
- Soft (8pt): Small chips, inline tags
- Comfortable (12pt): Media attachments, link/quote embed cards
- Large (16pt): Bottom sheets, modals
- Full Pill (500pt): Primary/secondary buttons, search field, the feed-tab underline is rounded
- Circle (50%): Avatars, compose FAB, like/repost hit circles

## 6. Depth & Elevation

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Flat (Level 0) | No shadow | Skeet cards, timeline, list rows |
| Card Hairline (Level 1) | 1pt divider per theme | Skeet-to-skeet separation |
| Embed Border (Level 1) | 1pt border, 12pt radius | Link cards, quote-skeets nested in body |
| FAB (Level 2) | `rgba(17,133,254,0.35) 0 6px 20px` | Floating compose button |
| Sheet (Level 3) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.15)` (light) / `rgba(0,0,0,0.5)` (dark) `0 -12px 40px` | Compose sheet, menus |
| Tab Bar Material | `translucent backdrop blur` over 94%-opaque canvas | Bottom tab bar over scrolling content |

**Shadow Philosophy**: Bluesky is flat by design — the timeline reads like a clean document. The only real elevation is the blue compose FAB (a brand-tinted shadow) and modal sheets. Cards and embeds use 1pt borders/dividers rather than drop shadows. In dark/dim modes, the sheet scrim deepens to 0.5; in light mode it stays barely-there at 0.15. The brightness comes from the canvas and the single blue accent, not from lighting.

### Motion
- **Like pop**: heart fills `#EC4899` and scales 1.0 → 1.25 → 1.0 over ~300ms spring, visible feedback state, count rolls
- **Repost**: icon turns `#2DBE85` with a quick 1.0 → 1.1 → 1.0 bounce, visible feedback state
- **Feed switch**: 0.25s cross-fade + small horizontal nudge between pinned feeds
- **Compose FAB**: scale 0.94 on press, visible feedback state; sheet presents with a 0.35s spring
- **Theme switch**: instant token swap with a 0.2s color cross-fade across surfaces
- **Pull-to-refresh**: standard system spinner, no custom flourish

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Offer all three themes: Light `#FFFFFF`, Dim `#1E2936`, Dark `#0B0F14`
- Reserve Bluesky Blue (`#1185FE`) for links, mentions, hashtags, active tab, FAB, primary buttons, and the butterfly logo
- Make the like a pink (`#EC4899`) pop-scale spring — it's the joyful signature
- Keep the pinned custom-feed selector at the top of Home and easy to switch
- Always show the full `@user.bsky.social` handle
- Show the reply-controls chip on the composer so reply-gating is visible
- Keep cards flat; separate with hairline dividers and 1pt embed borders
- Use the butterfly mark as the brand anchor in `#1185FE`

### Don't
- Don't ship only one theme — the triple-theme choice is part of the product
- Don't add accent colors beyond blue (and the pink like / green repost) — keep it clean
- Don't truncate the handle's `.bsky.social` domain
- Don't bury custom feeds in settings — the feed selector is first-class
- Don't box every skeet with heavy borders/shadows — dividers keep it quiet
- Don't make the like a static toggle — the spring pop is the personality
- Don't shrink body text below 15pt — Bluesky is conversational and readable
- Don't use heavy elevation — the only shadow is the FAB and modal sheets

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Device Sizes
| Device | Width | Key Changes |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| iPhone SE (3rd gen) | 375pt | Avatar 38pt; media grid still 2-col |
| iPhone 13/14/15 | 390pt | Standard 42pt avatar, 16pt padding |
| iPhone 15/16 Pro | 393pt | Dynamic Island clears the large title |
| iPhone 15/16 Pro Max | 430pt | Body measure widens; FAB stays 56pt |
| iPad | 768pt+ | Split view: feed + thread, max 640pt reading column, persistent left rail |

### Dynamic Type
- Skeet body, names, bios: full scale (conversational app — honor it)
- Action counts, timestamps: scale modestly
- Tab labels: fixed 10pt
- Feed-tab labels: scale modestly, fixed minimum 15pt

### Orientation
- Timeline / Profile: portrait and landscape (iPad split view)
- Media lightbox: rotates to landscape for wide media
- Compose: portrait-locked on iPhone

### Touch Targets
- Skeet action icons: 18pt glyph, 44pt hit circle
- Compose FAB: 56pt
- Tab icons: 26pt glyph, 44pt effective hit
- Feed-selector tabs: full label + 12pt padding tappable

### Safe Area Handling
- Top: butterfly nav and feed selector sit below safe area / Dynamic Island
- Bottom: FAB floats 16pt above the tab bar; both respect the home indicator
- Sides: 16pt content insets; banner edge-to-edge

### Iteration Guide
1. Ship three themes — Light `#FFFFFF`, Dim `#1E2936`, Dark `#0B0F14` — the choice is the product
2. Bluesky Blue `#1185FE` is links + navigation + primary actions + the butterfly; pink `#EC4899` like, green `#2DBE85` repost
3. The like is a springy pink pop-scale — make it the joyful moment
4. The pinned custom-feed selector lives at the top of Home — the feed is user-controlled
5. Always render the full `@user.bsky.social` handle
6. Cards are flat; separate with hairline dividers and 1pt embed borders — quiet timeline
7. Body text is 15pt at 1.4 line height — conversational and readable
8. The only elevation is the blue FAB and modal sheets — no heavy shadows

## React/Web Adaptation

- Implement the mobile information architecture as responsive React/Web UI.
- Use familiar web-accessible icons with equivalent meaning; platform-exclusive symbol names are source evidence, not implementation requirements.
- Express tactile or native feedback as visible pressed, loading, success, error, or motion states when the browser cannot provide an equivalent API.
- Preserve minimum touch target, safe-area, compact-density, bottom-navigation, and gesture intent using web capabilities.

## Provenance and Evidence

- Source repository: https://github.com/meliwat/awesome-ios-design-md
- Upstream commit: 5d3aeca239caef3ea4080034eb22ab87cc77fa24

- Inferences: React/Web adaptations identified as adaptations, not upstream facts.

## Known Gaps

- Native haptic APIs, platform-exclusive icon glyphs, and unverified device-specific motion are not Axhub implementation requirements.
- Brand behavior may change after the pinned upstream revision; revalidation requires a new commit pin and review record.
