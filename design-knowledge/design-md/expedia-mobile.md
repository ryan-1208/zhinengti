# Design System Inspiration of Expedia (iOS)

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

Expedia's iOS app is a **deal-forward travel marketplace** wrapped in a confident, trip-blue identity. The light canvas is a clean near-white (`#FFFFFF` / `#F5F7FA`) and the app's emotional center of gravity is the moment you see a *better price*: bundle savings, member prices, and One Key rewards are surfaced everywhere, almost always in the brand's signature **Expedia Yellow** (`#FFC94D`). The app is dense but not cluttered — it leans on full-bleed property and destination photography, big legible price typography, and a yellow "savings" accent that punches against the otherwise blue-and-grey chrome. Where Airbnb whispers and Notion disappears, Expedia *sells*: every card has a reason-to-believe (a strikethrough price, a "−24% Bundle" flag, a "Member price" tag, an "Earn 2,040 One Key cash" line).

The structural anchor is the **search-and-results loop**. Open the app and you land on a search surface with a segmented mode switch — **Stays / Flights / Cars / Packages (Bundle)** — sitting above a single tappable search pill ("San Diego, CA · Oct 12–17 · 2 travelers · 1 room"). Tap search and you drop into a vertically scrolling **results list** of property cards: a 16:10 hero photo with a deal flag top-left and a save-heart top-right, then title, neighborhood, a navy review-score badge ("9.2 Wonderful · 1,847 reviews"), a price block (strikethrough → discounted → "/ night"), and a gold One Key earn line. This card is the workhorse of the entire app and its anatomy is repeated for flights (fare cards) and cars.

Color is purposeful and role-bound. **Expedia Yellow** `#FFC94D` is the *savings/deal/loyalty highlight* — bundle tags, member-price flags, the One Key chip, primary "Bundle & save" CTAs. **Action Blue** `#1668E3` is the *interactive* color — links, secondary CTAs, the reserve button, selected states. **Expedia Navy** `#00355F` is the *brand/trust* color — the logomark field, review-score badge backgrounds, dark headers. **One Key gold** `#F5C518` is a tightly-scoped *rewards-only* color — One Key cash balances and "earn" lines, never used for generic UI. There is a clear hierarchy: navy says "trusted travel brand," blue says "tap me," yellow says "you're saving money," gold says "this is your loyalty currency."

Typography is **Expedia Sans** (the company's proprietary geometric humanist family, designed by Pentagram for the 2017+ rebrand), which falls back gracefully to **Inter** / SF Pro on iOS when the bundled face is unavailable. The hierarchy is product-UI rhythm (display → screen title → section → card title → body → meta → badge), not editorial. Prices are the loudest non-display element: an 18pt 800-weight number with a strikethrough antecedent and a quiet "/ night" suffix. Weights concentrate at 400 (body), 600 (subtitles, badges), 700 (card titles, sections), 800 (display, prices).

**Key Characteristics:**
- Light near-white canvas (`#FFFFFF` / `#F5F7FA`) light / navy-tinted charcoal (`#0E1116`) dark — content-forward, deal-forward
- Search-and-results loop — segmented Stays/Flights/Cars/Bundle switch → single search pill → vertical results list
- Property/fare result card — 16:10 hero, deal flag (top-left), save heart (top-right), title, location, review-score badge, price block, One Key earn line
- Expedia Yellow (`#FFC94D`) = savings/deal/loyalty highlight; never generic chrome
- Action Blue (`#1668E3`) = interactive (links, CTAs, selection)
- Expedia Navy (`#00355F`) = brand/trust (logomark, review badge, headers)
- One Key gold (`#F5C518`) = rewards-only (balances, earn lines, One Key chip)
- Navy review-score badge ("9.2 Wonderful · 1,847 reviews") — Expedia's signature trust signal
- Bundle + Save — packaging stay+flight+car for a discounted "Bundle" price (the core monetization gesture)
- Strikethrough → discounted price pattern on nearly every card
- Trips tab — itinerary timeline grouping flights, stays, cars under a single trip
- Bottom tab bar: Search / Saved / Trips / Support / Account

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Primary (Brand & Interactive)

### Review-Score Badge Color Ramp
The navy/blue/green badge that fronts every property — color shifts with score band.

| Score Band | Badge Background | Label Text |
|------------|------------------|------------|
| 9.0–10 (Wonderful) | `#1A8B4B` | Wonderful |
| 8.0–8.9 (Excellent) | `#1668E3` | Excellent |
| 7.0–7.9 (Very Good / Good) | `#14416B` | Good |
| 6.0–6.9 (Pleasant) | `#5A6573` | Pleasant |

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family
- **Primary**: `Expedia Sans` (proprietary, by Pentagram for Expedia Group, 2017+ rebrand) — geometric humanist sans tuned for travel commerce: legible price figures, generous x-height, confident bold weights.
- **Fallback Stack**: `'Expedia Sans', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'SF Pro Display', 'SF Pro Text', 'Inter', 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`
- **Closest free substitute**: `Inter` (by Rasmus Andersson, SIL OFL) — matched x-height, geometric construction, excellent tabular figures for prices.
- **Numerals**: Tabular/lining figures for all prices and review scores (so columns of prices align).

### Hierarchy

| Role | Font | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Display | Expedia Sans | 32pt | 800 | 1.15 | -0.6pt | Home hero ("Find your next trip") |
| Screen Title | Expedia Sans | 26pt | 800 | 1.2 | -0.4pt | Destination / results header |
| Section | Expedia Sans | 22pt | 700 | 1.25 | -0.2pt | "Bundle + Save deals" |
| Card Title | Expedia Sans | 18pt | 700 | 1.3 | -0.2pt | Property / fare name |
| Price (Now) | Expedia Sans | 18pt | 800 | 1.2 | -0.2pt | Discounted price figure |
| Body | Expedia Sans | 16pt | 400 | 1.5 | 0pt | Descriptions, policy text |
| Card Subtitle | Expedia Sans | 15pt | 600 | 1.35 | 0pt | Neighborhood, "0.4 mi from center" |
| Review Score | Expedia Sans | 15pt | 800 | 1.0 | 0pt | "9.2" inside navy badge |
| Meta | Expedia Sans | 14pt | 400 | 1.4 | 0pt | "1,847 reviews · Free cancellation" |
| Price (Strike) | Expedia Sans | 13pt | 400 | 1.0 | 0pt | Strikethrough antecedent price |
| Badge / Tag | Expedia Sans | 12pt | 600 | 1.0 | 0.2pt | "−24% Bundle", "Member price" |
| One Key Line | Expedia Sans | 11pt | 700 | 1.2 | 0.1pt | "Earn 2,040 One Key cash" |
| Button | Expedia Sans | 16pt | 700 | 1.0 | 0pt | Primary/secondary CTAs |
| Tab Label | Expedia Sans | 10pt | 600 | 1.0 | 0.1pt | Bottom tab labels |

### Principles
- **Price is the loudest content element**: discounted price at 18pt 800, strikethrough at 13pt 400 tertiary, "/ night" suffix at 12pt secondary — the eye lands on savings.
- **Tabular figures everywhere prices appear**: prices, review scores, point balances must align in vertical lists.
- **Weight concentrated at 400 / 600 / 700 / 800**: body regular, subtitles/badges semibold, titles/sections bold, display/prices extra-bold. No thin, no black.
- **Navy on yellow, white on blue**: text on Expedia Yellow is always navy `#00355F`; text on Action Blue is always white `#FFFFFF`.
- **Dynamic Type first-class**: display, titles, body, prices scale; tab labels, badges, One Key lines stay fixed.

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 4pt
- Scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64
- Card vertical gap: 16pt
- Card internal padding: 12–14pt
- Screen horizontal inset: 16pt
- Section header to first card: 10pt

### Grid & Container
- iPhone: single-column results list, 16pt insets, full-bleed hero photos within cards
- iPad: 2-column results grid (max content width 980pt centered, 24pt insets); detail uses split (list + map/detail)
- Map view: full-bleed map with floating result carousel at bottom

### Whitespace Philosophy
- **Commerce density with breathing room**: cards are information-dense (photo, title, score, price, loyalty) but separated by a generous 16pt gap so each is a discrete decision unit
- **Savings gets the spotlight**: yellow deal flags and One Key lines get their own visual lane — never crowded by body copy
- **Photo-first**: every result leads with a 16:10 photo; chrome is minimal over it (just deal flag + heart)

### Border Radius Scale
- Square (0pt): hero photo top edge (clipped to card), dividers
- Subtle (4pt): inline price chips
- Tag (6pt): deal flags, review-score badge
- Standard (8pt): buttons, text fields, inline banners
- Card (12–16pt): result cards, rewards strip, modules
- Pill (500pt): One Key chip, segmented control, map pins
- Circle (50%): save-heart hit area, avatars, One Key coin

## 6. Depth & Elevation

Expedia uses **soft, functional elevation** — cards lift just enough to read as tappable units; deal flags and CTAs sit flat on their surfaces.

| Level | Treatment (Light) | Treatment (Dark) | Use |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|-----|
| Flat (0) | none | none | Page background, deal flags, badges |
| Card (1) | `0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)` | `0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.4)` | Result cards, rewards strip, search pill |
| Floating (2) | `0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)` | `0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.55)` | Map result carousel, sticky CTA bar |
| Sheet (3) | `0 -8px 28px rgba(0,0,0,0.14)` | `0 -8px 28px rgba(0,0,0,0.6)` | Bottom sheets (filters, traveler picker) |
| Modal Scrim | `rgba(0,0,0,0.4)` | `rgba(0,0,0,0.55)` | Dim behind modals & sheets |

**Shadow Philosophy**: shadow signals "this is a tappable card / it floats." Deal flags, review badges, and the One Key chip are deliberately flat (color carries them). On dark, shadows deepen to 0.4–0.6 opacity to register over `#0E1116`.

### Motion
- **Card tap → detail**: shared-element hero photo expands, push transition 320ms ease-out
- **Save heart**: scale 1.0 → 1.2 → 1.0 over 220ms + visible feedback state; deal recalculates silently
- **Segmented switch**: active pill background + text crossfade 200ms ease-out
- **Price update (date change)**: old price cross-dissolves to new in 180ms; brief `#FFC94D` flash on the price if it dropped
- **Bundle reveal**: savings ribbon slides down + scales from 0.96 over 240ms ease-out when a flight is added
- **Filter sheet**: bottom sheet slides up 300ms ease-out; result count animates as filters toggle
- **Sticky CTA bar**: fades/translates in over 200ms once the user scrolls past the fold on a detail screen
- **Pull-to-refresh**: Expedia-yellow spinner
- **Haptics**: soft confirmation state on save, segment switch, date-range commit; visible feedback state on booking confirmation

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Expedia Yellow (`#FFC94D`) strictly for savings/deal/loyalty highlights — bundle tags, member prices, One Key chip, the "Bundle & save" CTA
- Put navy `#00355F` text on yellow, white on Action Blue `#1668E3`
- Lead every result card with a 16:10 photo; deal flag top-left, save heart top-right
- Show the review-score badge with score + word + count ("9.2 Wonderful · 1,847 reviews")
- Use the strikethrough → discounted price pattern when there is a real saving
- Reserve One Key gold (`#F5C518`) exclusively for rewards balances and earn lines
- Use Action Blue (`#1668E3`) for the primary "Reserve" CTA and all links
- Give cards a 16pt gap and a soft `0 4px 12px` shadow so each is a discrete decision
- Carry the search-and-results loop: segmented mode switch → search pill → vertical list
- Use a navy-biased dark canvas (`#0E1116`), NOT pure black
- Animate a brief yellow price flash when a price drops

### Don't
- Don't use Expedia Yellow for generic chrome, body text, or non-savings UI — it dilutes the savings signal
- Don't put white text on yellow or yellow text on blue (contrast + brand violation)
- Don't use One Key gold for anything other than rewards (no generic icons, no body accents)
- Don't show a strikethrough price when there is no real discount
- Don't bury the review-score badge — it's the primary trust signal and must front the card
- Don't use pure black (`#000000`) for the dark canvas — `#0E1116` carries the navy bias
- Don't make the bundle/savings CTA blue — the highest-intent action is yellow
- Don't over-shadow flat elements (deal flags, badges, One Key chip stay flat)
- Don't crowd the One Key earn line with other copy — it has its own lane
- Don't animate aggressively — motion is functional, 180–320ms ease-out
- Don't replace the segmented mode switch with a dropdown — Stays/Flights/Cars/Bundle is a glanceable, always-visible switch

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Device Sizes
| Device | Width | Key Changes |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| iPhone SE (3rd gen) | 375pt | Single column; hero photo 16:10; segmented switch labels may abbreviate |
| iPhone 13/14/15 | 390pt | Standard layout |
| iPhone 15/16 Pro | 393pt | Dynamic Island accommodated; sticky CTA respects safe area |
| iPhone 15/16 Pro Max | 430pt | Larger hero photos; 2-line meta has more room |
| iPad (portrait) | 768pt | 2-column results grid; detail in split view (list + detail) |
| iPad (landscape) | 1024pt+ | Results list + persistent map pane side-by-side |

### Dynamic Type
- Display, screen title, section, card title, body, prices: full scale
- Tab labels, deal flags/badges, One Key lines, review-score number: FIXED (layout-sensitive)
- Prices keep tabular figures at every scale

### Orientation
- iPhone: portrait-primary; landscape supported on detail/photo gallery
- iPad: full rotation; landscape unlocks side-by-side list + map

### Touch Targets
- Save heart: 30pt circle hit (20pt glyph)
- Tab bar icons: 22pt glyph, 44pt hit
- Segmented switch segment: full segment height (≥ 36pt)
- Search pill: full 52pt height tappable
- Primary CTA: ≥ 48pt tall

### Safe Area Handling
- Top app bar respects safe area + Dynamic Island
- Sticky CTA bar and bottom tab respect home indicator
- Map result carousel floats above bottom safe area
- Keyboard: search form scrolls above keyboard; date picker is a sheet above it

### Iteration Guide
1. Canvas is near-white (`#FFFFFF`/`#F5F7FA`) light, navy-biased charcoal `#0E1116` dark — NOT true black
2. Expedia Yellow `#FFC94D` is the savings/deal/loyalty color ONLY — never generic chrome; text on it is navy `#00355F`
3. Action Blue `#1668E3` is interactive — Reserve CTA, links, selection; white text on it
4. Every result card leads with a 16:10 photo, deal flag top-left, save heart top-right
5. The review-score badge (score + word + count) fronts every card — it's the trust signal
6. Use strikethrough → discounted price only when there's a real saving; prices use tabular figures
7. One Key gold `#F5C518` is rewards-only (balances, earn lines, One Key chip)
8. The search-and-results loop is the spine: segmented switch (Stays/Flights/Cars/Bundle) → search pill → vertical list
9. The highest-intent CTA ("Bundle & save") is yellow, not blue
10. Motion is functional 180–320ms ease-out; flash the price yellow when it drops

## React/Web Adaptation

- Implement the mobile information architecture as responsive React/Web UI.
- Use familiar web-accessible icons with equivalent meaning; platform-exclusive symbol names are source evidence, not implementation requirements.
- Express tactile or native feedback as visible pressed, loading, success, error, or motion states when the browser cannot provide an equivalent API.
- Preserve minimum touch target, safe-area, compact-density, bottom-navigation, and gesture intent using web capabilities.

## Provenance and Evidence

- Source repository: https://github.com/meliwat/awesome-ios-design-md
- Upstream commit: 5d3aeca239caef3ea4080034eb22ab87cc77fa24
- License: MIT
- Observed facts: values explicitly present in the framework-neutral upstream DESIGN.md and README.
- Inferences: React/Web adaptations identified as adaptations, not upstream facts.

## Known Gaps

- Native haptic APIs, platform-exclusive icon glyphs, and unverified device-specific motion are not Axhub implementation requirements.
- Brand behavior may change after the pinned upstream revision; revalidation requires a new commit pin and review record.
