# Design System Inspiration of Notion (iOS)

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

Notion's iOS app is an almost-invisible design system. The canvas is pure white (`#FFFFFF`) with barely any chrome, because Notion's philosophy is that the *content you write* is the interface. Open a page and you'll see a hero cover image (full-bleed, 120-200pt tall), a large emoji sitting just above the title, the title itself in Inter 32pt bold, and then a flow of "blocks" — paragraphs, headings, toggles, callouts, images — with no obvious framing, borders, or cards. This radical minimalism is deliberate: Notion is a blank canvas that takes on the shape of whatever the user is building (a journal, a wiki, a project tracker, a meeting note) and the UI is engineered to recede until it looks like a well-typed document.

The one piece of chrome that does appear is the **block handle** — a tiny 8pt dot-grid icon (⋮⋮⋮) and a `+` button that materialize on the left edge of a block when you hover (desktop) or long-press (mobile). These handles are the "interface" of Notion; they let you drag-reorder, duplicate, and insert blocks. The other signature UI moment is the **`/` command palette** — typing `/` at the start of a line opens a floating menu of block types (Heading, Toggle, Image, Callout, Database, Code, etc.) that is the primary creation gesture. Everything built in Notion flows through these two affordances.

The color system is muted, near-greyscale pastels. Page backgrounds can be set to nine colors (default white, gray, brown, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, red) — all desaturated and nearly paper-like (`#F1F1EF` gray, `#FAEBDD` orange, `#FBF3DB` yellow, `#EDF3EC` green, `#E7F3F8` blue, `#F6F3F9` purple, `#FAF1F5` pink, `#FDEBEC` red). These same hues (at stronger saturation) appear as callout block backgrounds, highlight chips on inline text, database tag colors, and cover images. The app has no primary CTA color — action is signaled by typography weight and position, not by a "Spotify Green" or "Gmail Red". The closest thing to an accent is links (`#2E75CC`) and the subtle Notion Black (`#000000`) on the primary "New page" button.

Typography is user-switchable in settings: **Inter** (default sans, the modern workhorse), **Lora** (optional serif, for more literary notes), or **IBM Plex Mono** (optional mono, for code/technical users). On iOS it falls back to SF Pro when the user's chosen face isn't bundled. Hierarchy is document-like: title at 32pt, heading 1 at 24pt, heading 2 at 20pt, heading 3 at 16pt, body at 16pt. All headings are weight 700 bold; body at 400. The type system prioritizes reading rhythm over brand expression — it reads like a well-designed Medium article, which is exactly what Notion wants.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Pure white canvas (`#FFFFFF`) light / dark charcoal (`#191919`) dark — minimum chrome, maximum content
- Block-based editor — every paragraph, heading, toggle, image is a draggable/replaceable "block"
- Block handles (⋮⋮⋮ + `+`) appear on hover/long-press as the primary interface affordance
- `/` command palette — type `/` to insert any block type — the core creation gesture
- Emoji as page icon + full-bleed cover image — the page "hero" is user-chosen, not designer-set
- Nine muted pastel page backgrounds + callout/highlight colors (Gray / Brown / Orange / Yellow / Green / Blue / Purple / Pink / Red)
- Inter / Lora / IBM Plex Mono — user-switchable typography in settings
- Toggle blocks — collapsible sections with ▸/▾ triangle affordance
- Database views: Table, Board (Kanban), Timeline, Calendar, Gallery, List — each a different rendering of the same block-row data
- Mentions (@-person or @-page) as inline interactive chips with avatar
- Minimal navigation chrome: slide-in sidebar from left, bottom tab strip with Home / Search / Updates / Settings

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Primary (Interactive)
- **Notion Black** (`#000000`): Primary interactive color — "New page" button background, primary CTAs.
- **Notion Black Pressed** (`#1A1A1A`): Pressed state.
- **Link Blue** (`#2E75CC`): Hyperlinks, @-mentions, selected text.

### Canvas & Surfaces (Light Mode)
- **Canvas White** (`#FFFFFF`): Primary light canvas.
- **Surface Gray** (`#F7F6F3`): Sidebar background, subtle elevated surfaces (e.g., "Recently visited" chips), hovered rows.
- **Surface Pressed** (`#EFEEE9`): Pressed/selected rows.
- **Divider** (`#EAECEC`): Hairline dividers between database rows and between page sections.
- **Selection Highlight** (`#2E75CC33`): 20% blue overlay on selected text.

### Canvas & Surfaces (Dark Mode)
- **Dark Canvas** (`#191919`): Primary dark canvas — Notion's signature dark, NOT pure black.
- **Dark Surface 1** (`#202020`): Sidebar, elevated surfaces.
- **Dark Surface 2** (`#2F2F2F`): Hovered rows, card backgrounds.
- **Dark Divider** (`#373737`): Hairline dividers.
- **Dark Link Blue** (`#529CCA`): Link color shifts lighter for contrast.

### Text
- **Text Primary Light** (`#37352F`): Primary body text — a warm dark gray, NOT pure black.
- **Text Secondary Light** (`#9B9A97`): Placeholder, metadata, block handle icons.
- **Text Tertiary Light** (`#C3C2BF`): Disabled, very low-emphasis.
- **Text Primary Dark** (`#E6E6E4`): Primary body on dark.
- **Text Secondary Dark** (`#9B9A97`): Same secondary on both modes (works for both).

- **Warning Orange** (`#D9730D`): Warning callouts.
- **Mention Background** (`#2E75CC1A`): 10% blue behind @-mentions inline.

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family
- **Default**: `Inter` (by Rasmus Andersson, 2020, SIL OFL licensed) — geometric humanist sans optimized for UI at small sizes, excellent hinting, extensive weight range.
- **Serif Option**: `Lora` (Google Fonts, SIL OFL) — transitional serif with calligraphic features, used for literary notes.
- **Mono Option**: `IBM Plex Mono` (by Bold Monday for IBM, SIL OFL) — technical mono face used for code blocks and tech-heavy note-takers.
- **Fallback Stack**: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'SF Pro Text', 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`
- **User-Switchable in Settings**: Default (Inter), Serif (Lora), Mono (IBM Plex Mono) — per user setting, applied to all pages

### Hierarchy

| Role | Font | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Page Title | Inter | 32pt | 700 | 1.2 | -0.5pt | Below page icon & cover, bold hero |
| Heading 1 (`/h1`) | Inter | 24pt | 700 | 1.25 | -0.3pt | Top-level section heading in page |
| Heading 2 (`/h2`) | Inter | 20pt | 700 | 1.3 | -0.2pt | Sub-section |
| Heading 3 (`/h3`) | Inter | 16pt | 700 | 1.4 | -0.1pt | Sub-sub-section |
| Body | Inter | 16pt | 400 | 1.5 | 0pt | Paragraph block default |
| Body (Dense) | Inter | 15pt | 400 | 1.4 | 0pt | Compact mode (user setting) |
| Code Inline | IBM Plex Mono | 14pt | 400 | 1.4 | 0pt | `inline code` highlighted with `#F7F6F3` bg |
| Code Block | IBM Plex Mono | 13pt | 400 | 1.5 | 0pt | Code blocks in fenced block |
| Caption | Inter | 14pt | 400 | 1.4 | 0pt | Image captions, small text |
| Quote | Lora | 17pt | 400 | 1.5 | 0pt | Italic quote block |
| Button | Inter | 14pt | 600 | 1.0 | 0pt | Primary/secondary buttons |
| Link | Inter | 16pt | 400 | 1.5 | 0pt | Inline link — underlined `#2E75CC` |
| Mention | Inter | 16pt | 500 | 1.5 | 0pt | @-chip text |
| Block Handle | Inter | 10pt | 400 | 1.0 | 0pt | ⋮⋮⋮ and + icons (actually icons, but adjacent caption uses this) |
| Placeholder | Inter | 16pt | 400 | 1.5 | 0pt | "Type '/' for commands" |
| Tab Label | Inter | 11pt | 500 | 1.0 | 0.1pt | Bottom tab labels |
| Sidebar Label | Inter | 14pt | 500 | 1.3 | 0pt | Sidebar page names |

### Principles
- **Document rhythm, not UI rhythm**: Type sizes and weights follow editorial conventions (title > H1 > H2 > H3 > body), not product-UI conventions (hero > section > card > caption).
- **Weight concentrated at 400 / 500 / 600 / 700**: Regular body, medium for emphasis, semibold for buttons, bold for headings. No thin, no black.
- **User controls family**: Respect the user's chosen type family (Inter/Lora/Mono) globally — don't hardcode Inter.
- **Monospace is for code only**: IBM Plex Mono appears on inline code and code blocks; nothing else.
- **Dynamic Type first-class**: Titles, headings, body, captions all scale; block handles, tab labels, mention chips stay fixed.

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 4pt
- Scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 96
- Block vertical gap: 6pt (tight reading flow)
- Heading top margin: 16pt (extra breathing room)
- Page content inset: 16pt horizontal

### Grid & Container
- iPhone: content at 16pt horizontal insets, full-bleed cover
- iPad: content at max-width 760pt centered, 24pt insets
- Sidebar width: 280pt (collapsed to 0 on iPhone; always visible on iPad landscape)
- Database table: horizontal scroll within the block

### Whitespace Philosophy
- **Document rhythm**: 6pt between paragraph blocks, 16pt before headings — reads like a well-designed article
- **Minimal chrome everywhere**: the only chrome is block handles (which appear on hover / long-press, not always visible)
- **Hero zone is optional**: cover image + emoji + title zone can be any height user wants (no cover = 0pt hero)
- **Callouts and code breathe**: 16pt internal padding, so they stand out from inline text without needing borders

### Border Radius Scale
- Square (0pt): Divider lines, full-bleed covers
- Subtle (4pt): Callout blocks, code blocks, image blocks, chips
- Standard (6pt): Buttons, search bar, / command palette
- Comfortable (12pt): Bottom sheets, modals
- Pill (500pt): Rarely used — the toggle switches in settings
- Circle (50%): Avatars

## 6. Depth & Elevation

Notion is radically flat. Shadows exist only in three contexts:

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Flat (Level 0) | No shadow | Page content, blocks, sidebar rows |
| Floating (Level 1) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.08) 0 4px 12px` | `/` command palette, @-mention picker, block menu |
| Sheet (Level 2) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 0 -4px 24px` | Bottom sheets (Share, emoji picker, move-to-workspace) |
| Modal Overlay | `rgba(0,0,0,0.3)` | Dim behind modals and bottom sheets |

**Shadow Philosophy**: Notion doesn't use shadow as a visual style — it uses it purely as a "this is floating, tap outside to dismiss" signal. The command palette, mention picker, and block menu all get a light `0 4px 12px` shadow so they clearly float above the page without adding visual noise. On dark mode, shadows become harder to see, so Notion adds a subtle 1pt border to floating panels as a secondary affordance.

### Motion
- **Block reorder (drag)**: 60fps drag following finger; other blocks shift over 200ms ease-out to make room; drop snaps into position with 150ms ease-out + visible feedback state
- **Toggle expand/collapse**: chevron rotates 90° in 150ms; children slide down with height 0 → auto over 200ms ease-out
- **`/` command palette**: fade-in + 4pt slide-down in 150ms ease-out; fade-out + 4pt slide-up on dismiss; arrow-key selection is instant (no animation)
- **Page navigation**: push transition in 300ms (iOS native push), horizontal slide
- **Sidebar swipe**: edge-swipe drags sidebar with 1:1 finger tracking; release threshold at 50% commits open/close with 250ms spring damping 0.8
- **Block handle reveal**: on long-press (400ms hold), handles fade-in over 120ms
- **Selection highlight**: blue `#2E75CC33` overlay appears instantly on text selection
- **Emoji picker**: bottom sheet slides up with 300ms ease-out
- **Page save (auto)**: no visible motion — silent; toast "Saved" appears only on manual save or error
- **Haptic feedback**: soft impact on toggle expand, block drag start, command palette open

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use pure white (`#FFFFFF`) as the light canvas — Notion is paper
- Use dark charcoal (`#191919`) for dark mode — NOT true black
- Use warm dark text (`#37352F`) — NOT pure black
- Surface block handles (⋮⋮⋮ + `+`) on long-press (mobile) or hover (desktop) — never always-visible
- Use the `/` command as the primary block-creation gesture — it's the heart of Notion
- Respect user's chosen font family globally (Inter / Lora / IBM Plex Mono)
- Render callouts with pastel backgrounds + leading emoji — never with borders
- Use toggles (▸/▾) for collapsible sections — the chevron always leading, 4pt from text
- Embed databases as blocks — they have their own view switcher (Table / Board / Timeline / Calendar / Gallery / List)
- Make mentions inline chips with avatar + blue background — never plain blue text
- Keep chrome minimal — content is the interface

### Don't
- Don't use card-style borders around content blocks — Notion is flat, content flows inline
- Don't use saturated colors as page backgrounds — the 9 pastels are all near-greyscale
- Don't hard-code Inter — users can switch to Lora (serif) or IBM Plex Mono
- Don't surface block handles always — the "invisible" design is the signature
- Don't use pure black (`#000000`) for body text — `#37352F` warm dark gray is correct
- Don't add primary-color CTAs ("Add", "Save" should be black or ghost) — Notion doesn't have a brand accent
- Don't animate aggressively — motion is quiet, 150-300ms ease-out range
- Don't use shadow on content blocks — shadows are reserved for floating panels only
- Don't bold "Body" paragraphs by default — body is 400 weight
- Don't use column layouts without user request — Notion's defaults are single-column top-to-bottom
- Don't surface the full block menu on tap — tap inserts cursor; long-press opens handles; tap ⋮⋮⋮ opens menu

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Device Sizes
| Device | Width | Key Changes |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| iPhone SE (3rd gen) | 375pt | Cover image 100pt tall; sidebar is 80% screen width |
| iPhone 13/14/15 | 390pt | Standard layout |
| iPhone 15/16 Pro | 393pt | Dynamic Island accommodated in top nav |
| iPhone 15/16 Pro Max | 430pt | Cover image 140pt tall; larger emoji |
| iPad (portrait) | 768pt | 2-column: sidebar always visible (280pt) + content (centered max 760pt) |
| iPad (landscape) | 1024pt+ | Same 2-column; content max 800pt centered |

### Dynamic Type
- Page title, headings, body, captions: full scale
- Block handles, tab labels, sidebar labels, mention chips, command palette option text: FIXED (layout-sensitive)
- Code blocks: scale to XL (but stay monospace)

### Orientation
- All pages support rotation
- iPad adds split-view controller: primary sidebar (280pt) + secondary page content
- Video/image blocks rotate freely

### Touch Targets
- Block handle (⋮⋮⋮): 28pt hit, 20pt glyph
- Tab bar icons: 24pt glyph, 44pt hit
- Sidebar row: 32pt tall, full-row tap
- Toggle chevron: 16pt glyph, 44pt hit
- Primary buttons: 36pt tall minimum

### Safe Area Handling
- Top: top nav respects safe area and Dynamic Island
- Bottom: bottom tab + home indicator respected
- Keyboard: page body scrolls above keyboard; command palette positions above keyboard when triggered
- Sides: 16pt content inset

### Example Component Prompts
- "Build the Notion page header in responsive React/Web: 120pt full-bleed cover image at top (optional — if no cover, skip this row). Below: 64pt emoji icon at leading 16pt with -32pt top offset (overlaps cover). Below emoji: page title in Inter 32pt weight 700 `#37352F`, 16pt horizontal inset. Below title: sub-actions row with small ghost buttons 'Add icon', 'Add cover', 'Add comment' — Inter 13pt w400 `#9B9A97`, 8pt horizontal padding, no background, visible only when page is empty."

- "Create a Notion paragraph block: 16pt horizontal insets, 6pt bottom margin, Inter 16pt weight 400 `#37352F`. On long-press (400ms), fade-in leading block handle ⋮⋮⋮ (20pt `#9B9A97` at 50% opacity) + `+` insert-below icon, positioned at -24pt left of block. Empty-state placeholder: 'Type ''/'' for commands' in `#9B9A97`."

- "Render the Notion `/` command palette: floating panel anchored at cursor. 280pt wide (or full-width minus 16pt on phone), `#FFFFFF` bg, 1pt `#EAECEC` border, 6pt corner radius, shadow `rgba(0,0,0,0.08) 0 4px 12px`. Max height 360pt scroll. Each row: 40pt tall, leading 20pt block-type icon, title in Inter 14pt w500 `#37352F`, subtitle in Inter 12pt w400 `#9B9A97`. Up/down arrows navigate; selected row: `#EFEEE9` background. Tap or Enter inserts block. Dismiss: fade-out + 4pt slide-up in 150ms."

- "Build a Notion callout block: full-width minus 16pt insets, 16pt all padding, 4pt corner radius, background one of the pastel page colors (default yellow `#FBF3DB` with text `#DFAB01`, or blue `#E7F3F8` with `#0B6E99`, etc.). Leading 20pt emoji glyph (user-picked). Content area: Inter 16pt w400 in the matching callout text color. No border."

- "Create a Notion toggle block: leading chevron ▸ (16pt `#9B9A97`) at 4pt gap from text, text in Inter 16pt w500 `#37352F`. On tap: chevron rotates 90° to ▾ over 150ms, children slide down from height 0 → auto over 200ms ease-out. Children indented 24pt from left. visible feedback state on toggle."

- "Render the Notion sidebar: 280pt wide, `#F7F6F3` background, slides in from left with 250ms ease-out when swipe-right or hamburger tapped. Header: 48pt workspace row with 24pt workspace icon + name + chevron. Sections: 'Teamspaces', 'Shared', 'Private'. Each page row: 32pt tall, leading 16pt emoji/page-icon, title in Inter 14pt w500 `#37352F`, trailing ⋯ menu. Active page: `#EFEEE9` background. Nested children indented 24pt per level with leading chevron."

### Iteration Guide
1. Canvas is pure white (`#FFFFFF`) in light, charcoal `#191919` in dark — NOT true black, NOT off-white
2. Text primary is warm gray `#37352F` — NOT pure black; body at 400 weight, headings at 700
3. Page-background pastels are all desaturated near-greyscale (gray/brown/orange/yellow/green/blue/purple/pink/red) — NOT bright
4. Block handles (⋮⋮⋮ + `+`) appear only on long-press/hover — "invisible until needed" is the signature
5. Typography is user-switchable: default Inter, optional Lora (serif) or IBM Plex Mono — respect user setting globally
6. The `/` command palette is the primary block-creation gesture — a floating 280pt panel anchored at cursor
7. Blocks flow top-to-bottom with 6pt gap — no cards, no borders, no shadows on content
8. Callouts use pastel backgrounds + leading emoji, text in matching saturated color — NEVER with borders
9. Primary CTAs are Notion Black (`#000000`) — the app has no brand accent color
10. Mentions (@person / @page) are inline chips with avatar + 10% blue background + blue text — never plain inline text

## React/Web Adaptation

- Implement the mobile information architecture as responsive React/Web UI.
- Use familiar web-accessible icons with equivalent meaning; platform-exclusive symbol names are source evidence, not implementation requirements.
- Express tactile or native feedback as visible pressed, loading, success, error, or motion states when the browser cannot provide an equivalent API.
- Preserve minimum touch target, safe-area, compact-density, bottom-navigation, and gesture intent using web capabilities.

## Provenance and Evidence

- Source repository: https://github.com/meliwat/awesome-ios-design-md
- Upstream commit: 5d3aeca239caef3ea4080034eb22ab87cc77fa24
- License: MIT
- Observed facts: values explicitly present in the framework-neutral upstream DESIGN.md and README.
- Inferences: React/Web adaptations identified as adaptations, not upstream facts.

## Known Gaps

- Native haptic APIs, platform-exclusive icon glyphs, and unverified device-specific motion are not Axhub implementation requirements.
- Brand behavior may change after the pinned upstream revision; revalidation requires a new commit pin and review record.
