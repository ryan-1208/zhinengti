# Design System Inspiration of McDonald's (iOS)

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

McDonald's iOS app is **a loyalty-and-ordering machine wearing the most recognizable brand colors on earth**. The instant you open it, two things establish identity: the **Golden Arches Yellow `#FFC72C`** and **McDonald's Red `#DA291C`**. The canvas is white (`#FFFFFF`) in light mode and a near-black charcoal (`#121212`) in dark mode, but the screen is *carried* by the yellow — it is the rewards points number, the primary CTA pill, the active tab, the order FAB, and the arches logomark. Red is the energetic counterpoint: deal flags, the secondary "Add to Mobile Order" button, urgency states. The aesthetic is bold, rounded, friendly, and unmistakably fast-food — pill-shaped buttons everywhere, generous rounding, big confident type, and appetizing product photography on every deal tile.

The signature screen is the **home / deals + mobile-order hub**. It opens with a personal greeting ("Hi, Alex" with the arches), then the hero of the whole app: the **MyMcDonald's Rewards** card — a points balance in huge yellow numerals, a progress bar toward the next reward, and a "X points away from a free …" line. Below it, a **Deals & Rewards** grid of two-up tiles (product photo + red "DEAL"/"FREE" flag + name + offer + "or N,NNN pts"), and a **Start an order** mode selector: four large pill/tile choices — **Pickup**, **Curbside**, **Drive Thru**, **Delivery** — the active one outlined in yellow. The second signature surface is the **deal/coupon detail** — a dashed-yellow-bordered coupon card with the food image, the offer, validity, and an "Add to order" yellow pill that drops the deal into a mobile order.

The color system is deliberately tiny and iconic: yellow + red carry everything, over a neutral canvas, with a single success green for "Order Ready". There is a hard brand rule baked into the system — **yellow always pairs with near-black text (`#1A1A1A`), never white**; the arches are never recolored. The mood is *cheerful efficiency*: get the user to a deal and into a mobile order in as few taps as possible, and make the rewards balance feel rewarding every time the app opens.

Typography is McDonald's proprietary **Speedee** — a friendly, slightly rounded humanist sans designed for the brand's signage and digital. On iOS it falls back to SF Pro (or a rounded grotesque) when Speedee isn't bundled; for documentation and the catalog, **Archivo** is the closest free analog. The hierarchy is heavy and confident: screen titles at 32pt/900, the rewards number at 28pt/900, card titles at 18pt/800, body at 16pt/400. Weight (800/900) and the yellow accent do the heavy lifting.

**Key Characteristics:**
- White canvas (`#FFFFFF`) light / near-black charcoal (`#121212`) dark — carried by **Golden Arches Yellow `#FFC72C`**
- Two-color brand system: **Yellow `#FFC72C`** (primary CTA, rewards, active tab, FAB) + **Red `#DA291C`** (deal flags, secondary CTA, urgency)
- Hard rule: yellow always pairs with near-black text `#1A1A1A` — **never white on yellow**; arches never recolored
- MyMcDonald's Rewards card — the home hero: huge yellow points number + progress bar + "X points to free …"
- Deals grid — two-up product-photo tiles with a red "DEAL"/"FREE"/"NEW" flag, offer line, and points alternative
- Mobile-order mode selector — Pickup / Curbside / Drive Thru / Delivery as four large tiles, active outlined yellow
- Pill-shaped buttons everywhere — 999pt radius CTAs; rounded 16pt cards
- Center "Order" FAB in the tab bar — elevated yellow circle, the app's primary action
- Coupon/deal cards — dashed yellow border, food photo, "Add to order" yellow pill
- Friendly heavy type — Speedee (Archivo fallback), screen titles 32pt/900, weight + yellow carry hierarchy
- Personal greeting header — "Hi, {name}" with the arches and a notification bell

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family
- **Brand / All UI**: `Speedee` — McDonald's proprietary humanist sans (friendly, slightly rounded; designed for signage + digital). Bundled in the official app.
- **iOS Fallback Stack**: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'SF Pro Rounded', 'SF Pro Display', 'SF Pro Text', 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`
- **Web/Catalog Fallback**: `Archivo` (closest free grotesque with the same confident weight range)
- Numerals are tabular in points, prices, and timers so balances and totals align.

### Hierarchy

| Role | Font | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Screen Title | Speedee | 32pt | 900 | 1.2 | -0.4pt | "Rewards", "Menu" large title |
| Rewards Number | Speedee | 28pt | 900 | 1.0 | -0.5pt | The points balance — yellow |
| Hero / Tagline | Speedee | 26pt | 800 | 1.25 | -0.3pt | "i'm lovin' it", promo headline |
| Greeting | Speedee | 22pt | 800 | 1.25 | -0.4pt | "Hi, {name}" |
| Card Title | Speedee | 18pt | 800 | 1.3 | -0.3pt | "MyMcDonald's Rewards", section card |
| Section Header | Speedee | 19pt | 800 | 1.3 | -0.3pt | "Deals & Rewards", "Start an order" |
| Body | Speedee | 16pt | 400 | 1.5 | 0pt | Descriptions, paragraph copy |
| Deal Title | Speedee | 15pt | 600 | 1.4 | 0pt | "Buy one, get one $1" |
| Price / Points | Speedee | 14pt | 700 | 1.4 | 0pt | "$5.99" / "1,900 pts" — tabular |
| Meta | Speedee | 14pt | 400 | 1.4 | 0pt | "Valid through Sun", store name |
| Badge / Flag | Speedee | 12pt | 800 | 1.1 | 0.3pt | "DEAL", "FREE", "NEW" — UPPERCASE |
| Button (Primary) | Speedee | 15pt | 800 | 1.0 | 0.1pt | Pill CTAs |
| Caption | Speedee | 12pt | 400 | 1.4 | 0pt | T&C, tiny print |
| Tab Label | Speedee | 10pt | 700 | 1.0 | 0.1pt | Bottom tab labels |
| Mode Tile Label | Speedee | 11pt | 700 | 1.1 | 0pt | "Pickup", "Curbside" |

### Principles
- **Weight + yellow carry hierarchy**: emphasis lives at 800/900 and in the Golden Arches Yellow. The rewards number is the single largest, heaviest, most colorful element on the home screen.
- **Friendly, not corporate**: Speedee's slight roundness keeps the heavy weights warm — pair with rounded shapes (pill buttons, 16pt cards) to keep the tone cheerful.
- **Tabular numerals for points/money/timers**: the rewards balance, deal points, prices, and the "order ready in X min" timer all align.
- **UPPERCASE flags**: deal flags and status badges are uppercase with +0.3pt tracking — punchy and scannable.
- **Dynamic Type**: titles, body, deal copy scale; the rewards number, badges/flags, tab labels, and mode-tile labels stay fixed (layout-critical).

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 4pt
- Scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64
- Card vertical gap: 16pt
- Screen horizontal inset: 18pt
- Intra-card content gaps: 3–8pt
- Section header top margin: 16pt

### Grid & Container
- iPhone: single-column scroll; deals in a 2-up grid (12pt gutter); order modes in a 4-up row
- Horizontal carousels (featured deals, favorites): 12pt gap, peek of next tile
- iPad: 2–3 column deal grid, max content width 760pt centered, 24pt insets
- Order FAB is a fixed 50pt circle centered in the tab bar, lifted -6pt

### Whitespace Philosophy
- **Rounded and roomy**: pill buttons + 16pt cards + generous gaps keep the tone friendly, never cramped
- **The rewards card owns the top**: it's the largest, most colorful block — points are the reason to open the app
- **Photos sell deals**: every deal tile leads with appetizing product imagery; chrome stays minimal around it
- **Two colors, disciplined**: yellow for primary action + rewards, red for deals/urgency; everything else neutral so the brand colors pop

### Border Radius Scale
- Square (0pt): full-bleed imagery edges, dividers
- Subtle (6pt): deal flags, small badges
- Compact (8pt): chips, inline tags
- Comfortable (12pt): form fields, order-mode tiles
- Card (16pt): rewards card, deal tiles, sheets' content cards
- Sheet (20pt): bottom sheets (curbside, customise, payment)
- Pill (999pt): all CTAs, search field, rewards/status pills
- Circle (50%): icon buttons, the order FAB, avatars

## 6. Depth & Elevation

McDonald's is mostly flat and rounded; elevation marks the one action the app most wants you to take.

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Flat (Level 0) | No shadow, 1pt divider/border | Deal tiles, rewards card, list rows |
| Lifted (Level 1) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.10) 0 2px 8px` light / `rgba(0,0,0,0.5) 0 4px 12px` dark | Sticky bottom CTA bar, floating coupon |
| Order FAB (Level 2) | `rgba(255,199,44,0.40) 0 6px 16px` | The center Order FAB — a glowing yellow call-to-action |
| Sheet (Level 3) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.12) 0 -4px 24px` | Bottom sheets (curbside, customise, payment) |
| Modal Overlay | `rgba(0,0,0,0.5)` | Dim behind sheets and dialogs |

**Shadow Philosophy**: Cards are flat (border/divider defines them). The one element that *glows* is the Order FAB — its yellow-tinted shadow makes it read as the app's heartbeat, lifting above the tab bar. Sticky CTA bars get a soft top shadow so they detach from scrolling content. On dark mode, shadows deepen and the Order FAB's yellow glow is even more prominent; bottom sheets gain a 1pt `#2C2C2E` top border.

### Motion
- **Add to Mobile Order**: tapping a deal's CTA animates the item flying into the Order FAB; the FAB pulses once (scale 1.0→1.08→1.0, 260ms) with a visible feedback state; a count badge pops on the FAB
- **Rewards progress**: on app open or after earning, the yellow fill animates from current → new over 600ms ease-out; the points number rolls (counting up)
- **Order-mode select**: tile border + fill cross-fade to yellow over 150ms; the store-picker section expands beneath over 220ms ease-out
- **Deal tile tap**: shared-element image zoom into the deal detail, 300ms ease-out
- **Curbside "I'm here"**: button fills, a checkmark draws (200ms), status text crossfades to "On our way to spot N"
- **Order status step**: each step ticks with a soft pop; the "READY" badge flips green with a 1.05 scale bounce + visible feedback state
- **Bottom sheet**: slides up 300ms ease-out; dim fades in parallel; drag-to-dismiss with rubber-banding
- **Pull-to-refresh**: yellow arches spinner; visible feedback state tick on release
- **Haptics**: soft impact on add-to-order, light tick on mode select & chip toggle, success notification on order placed / reward redeemed

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Golden Arches Yellow (`#FFC72C`) for the primary CTA, rewards number, active tab, and Order FAB
- Always put `#1A1A1A` near-black text/icons on yellow — it's a hard brand rule
- Use McDonald's Red (`#DA291C`) for deal flags, the secondary CTA, and urgency
- Make the MyMcDonald's Rewards card the home hero — big yellow points number + progress bar
- Lead every deal tile with appetizing product photography + a red flag
- Use pill (999pt) buttons and rounded 16pt cards throughout — the language is round and friendly
- Elevate the center Order FAB with a yellow-tinted glow shadow
- Offer the four order modes (Pickup / Curbside / Drive Thru / Delivery) as large tiles, active outlined yellow
- Roll the points number and animate the progress fill when rewards change
- Use tabular numerals for points, prices, and timers
- Keep dark mode near-black (`#121212`) with full-saturation food photography

### Don't
- Don't put white text on yellow — ever; near-black `#1A1A1A` only
- Don't recolor or restyle the Golden Arches
- Don't introduce a third loud brand color competing with yellow + red
- Don't use sharp-cornered buttons — CTAs are pills, cards are 16pt rounded
- Don't bury the rewards balance — it's the reason the app is opened; it leads the home screen
- Don't shrink or crop deal photography to thumbnails — product imagery sells the deal
- Don't hide the Order FAB — it's the elevated center of the tab bar and the app's primary action
- Don't use pure black (`#000000`) for the dark canvas — `#121212` is correct
- Don't desaturate food imagery in dark mode — chrome recedes, food does not
- Don't animate aggressively — motion is cheerful and quick (150–300ms), tied to ordering/rewards
- Don't use timid sentence-case flags — deal flags are UPPERCASE and punchy

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Device Sizes
| Device | Width | Key Changes |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| iPhone SE (3rd gen) | 375pt | Single column; deals stay 2-up but shorter photos; compact greeting |
| iPhone 13/14/15 | 390pt | Standard layout |
| iPhone 15/16 Pro | 393pt | Dynamic Island accommodated; greeting respects it |
| iPhone 15/16 Pro Max | 430pt | Larger deal photos; bigger rewards number |
| iPad (portrait) | 768pt | 2–3 column deal grid; rewards card spans top; content max 760pt centered |
| iPad (landscape) | 1024pt+ | 3-column deals; persistent order summary panel on the right |

### Dynamic Type
- Screen titles, section headers, body, deal copy: full scale
- Rewards number, deal flags, status badges, tab labels, mode-tile labels: FIXED (layout-critical)
- Prices/points scale one step then truncate gracefully

### Orientation
- iPhone: portrait-locked for the order flow (category standard)
- iPad: supports landscape with a 3-column grid + sticky order panel

### Touch Targets
- Pill CTA: ≥ 48pt tall
- Order FAB: 50pt circle, 56pt+ hit area
- Order-mode tile: full-tile tap, ≥ 64pt tall
- Tab bar icon: 22pt glyph, 44pt+ hit
- Rewards card: full-card tap to open catalog

### Safe Area Handling
- Top: greeting + Dynamic Island respected
- Bottom: Order FAB and tab bar above the home indicator; sticky CTA bar pins above the tab bar
- Keyboard: address/promo forms scroll above keyboard; curbside sheet positions above it

Body: name 'Big Mac' Speedee 14pt/800 `#F2F2F2`; offer 'Buy one, get one $1' 12pt `#A0A0A0`; then 'or 1,900 pts' in `#FFC72C` 11pt/800 with a leading 11pt star. Whole tile tappable. Lay out two per row with a 12pt gutter."

- "Render the McDonald's order-mode selector: a card holding four tiles in a row — Pickup, Curbside, Drive Thru, Delivery. Each tile: 12pt rounded, 1.5pt `#2C2C2E` border, transparent fill, a 22pt centered icon and an 11pt/700 label `#F2F2F2`. The active tile uses a 1.5pt `#FFC72C` border, `rgba(255,199,44,0.08)` fill, and tints the icon + label `#FFC72C`. Selecting one expands a store-picker section beneath over 220ms ease-out."

- "Build the McDonald's bottom tab bar: 5 tabs — Home, Rewards, Order (center FAB), Menu, More. The center Order item is a 50pt `#FFC72C` circle with a `#1A1A1A` cart glyph, lifted -6pt above the bar, with a `rgba(255,199,44,0.40) 0 6px 16px` shadow and the label 'Order' in `#FFC72C`. Side tabs: 22pt glyph, active = filled glyph `#FFC72C`, inactive = stroke `#888`, labels 10pt/700 always shown. Bar background `rgba(18,18,18,0.94)` blurred with a 0.5pt `#2C2C2E` top divider."

- "Create the McDonald's primary button: a pill (999pt radius), `#FFC72C` background, text in `#1A1A1A` (NEVER white) Speedee 15pt/800, 14pt vertical / 28pt horizontal padding, full-width in cart. Pressed: `#E6B015` + scale 0.98. Provide a secondary variant: `#DA291C` background, white text, same shape."

- "Render the McDonald's deal/coupon detail card: 14pt rounded card with a dashed `#FFC72C` border. Leading 84pt food-image strip; body with name Speedee 14pt/800 `#F2F2F2`, sub 12pt `#A0A0A0`, validity line; an 'Add to order' yellow pill (`#FFC72C` bg, `#1A1A1A` text, 999pt radius, Speedee 11pt/800 UPPERCASE). Tapping 'Add to order' animates the item flying into the Order FAB, which pulses scale 1.0→1.08→1.0 over 260ms with a visible feedback state and a count-badge pop."

### Iteration Guide
1. Yellow (`#FFC72C`) carries primary action + rewards; red (`#DA291C`) carries deals + urgency — only these two brand colors
2. Text on yellow is ALWAYS `#1A1A1A` near-black, never white — hard brand rule; arches never recolored
3. The MyMcDonald's Rewards card is the home hero — huge yellow points number + animated progress bar
4. Every deal tile leads with appetizing product photography + a red `DEAL`/`FREE` flag
5. All CTAs are pills (999pt); all cards are 16pt rounded — the language is round and friendly
6. The center Order FAB is an elevated, yellow-glowing circle — the app's primary action
7. Offer Pickup / Curbside / Drive Thru / Delivery as four tiles; the active one is outlined yellow
8. Roll the points number and animate the progress fill whenever rewards change
9. Dark canvas is `#121212` (near-black); food photography stays full-saturation
10. Motion is cheerful and quick (150–300ms), always tied to ordering or rewards (fly-to-FAB, points roll, status flip)

## React/Web Adaptation

- Implement the mobile information architecture as responsive React/Web UI.
- Use familiar web-accessible icons with equivalent meaning; platform-exclusive symbol names are source evidence, not implementation requirements.
- Express tactile or native feedback as visible pressed, loading, success, error, or motion states when the browser cannot provide an equivalent API.
- Preserve minimum touch target, safe-area, compact-density, bottom-navigation, and gesture intent using web capabilities.

## Provenance and Evidence

- Source repository: https://github.com/meliwat/awesome-ios-design-md
- Upstream commit: 5d3aeca239caef3ea4080034eb22ab87cc77fa24
- License: MIT
- Observed facts: values explicitly present in the framework-neutral upstream DESIGN.md and README.
- Inferences: React/Web adaptations identified as adaptations, not upstream facts.

## Known Gaps

- Native haptic APIs, platform-exclusive icon glyphs, and unverified device-specific motion are not Axhub implementation requirements.
- Brand behavior may change after the pinned upstream revision; revalidation requires a new commit pin and review record.
