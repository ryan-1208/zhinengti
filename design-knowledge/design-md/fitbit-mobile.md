# Design System Inspiration of Fitbit (iOS)

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

Fitbit's iOS app is a warm, encouraging health dashboard organized around a single screen: **Today**. The atmosphere is "supportive coach," not "clinical chart" — the app celebrates progress, nudges gently, and turns biometric data into friendly, glanceable cards. The dark theme is a deep teal-black (`#001017` → `#002A3A`) that carries the brand's cyan undertone rather than a neutral gray, so the whole product feels distinctly Fitbit even before any color appears. Content is laid out as a vertical scroll of generously rounded cards and tiles (16–24pt radii), each one a self-contained "stat object" with a big number, a metric icon, a short label, and a progress ring or trend chip.

The brand color is **Fitbit Teal** (`#00B0B9`) — it is the logo, the steps/activity color, the primary CTA, and the active tab. On dark backgrounds it brightens to a more luminous teal (`#21D9CE`) for text and links so it never muddies. The defining system characteristic is **per-metric color coding**: every health metric owns one fixed hue and keeps it everywhere it appears (tile icon, ring, chart line, detail screen). Steps/Activity = teal `#00B0B9`, Heart Rate = coral `#FF6B81`, Sleep = purple `#7C5CFF`, Daily Readiness = lime `#B8E986`, Active Zone Minutes = orange `#FF8A3D`, Calories = gold `#FFC233`. This means a user can recognize "that's my sleep data" purely by the purple, anywhere in the app — color is a navigational and mnemonic system, not decoration.

The signature visual moments are: the **steps ring hero** at the top of Today (a large circular progress ring with the step count centered and an encouraging side message), the grid of **metric tiles** (rounded squares, each in its metric color), the **Sleep score** card (a 0–100 score with a stage breakdown), and the **Daily Readiness** card (a 0–100 lime score with a plain-language recommendation). Progress rings are the recurring shape language — Fitbit thinks in rings: steps, sleep stages, zone minutes, hydration.

Typography is a rounded-friendly geometric sans. Fitbit uses a humanist face close to **DM Sans** for everything: huge numbers for hero metrics (40–44pt bold, tight tracking), warm 22pt greetings ("Good morning, Maya"), 18pt bold card titles, and approachable 16pt body. Numbers are the loudest element on every screen — the design philosophy is "make the number the hero, make the message kind."

**Key Characteristics:**
- Deep teal-black dark canvas (`#001017` → `#002A3A`) — cyan undertone, not neutral gray
- Fitbit Teal (`#00B0B9`) brand / steps / CTA; brightens to `#21D9CE` for text on dark
- **Per-metric color system**: each metric owns a fixed hue everywhere (steps teal, HR coral, sleep purple, readiness lime, zone orange, calories gold)
- Today dashboard: vertical scroll of generously rounded cards & tiles (16–24pt)
- Steps ring hero — big circular progress ring + centered count + encouraging side copy
- Metric tile grid — rounded squares, big number, metric icon chip, sub-line
- Sleep score (0–100) + stage breakdown; Daily Readiness score (0–100, lime)
- Progress rings everywhere — the recurring shape language
- Trend chips — "▲ 12% vs last week" pill in metric color
- Encouraging, plain-language coaching copy ("You're close!", "Good to go")
- Bottom tab bar (4): Today, Coach, Community, You
- Pill-shaped CTAs; big bold numbers as the visual hero of every card

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family
- **Primary**: Fitbit's brand sans — use **DM Sans** (by Colophon Foundry / Indian Type Foundry, SIL OFL) as the open stand-in. A geometric, slightly rounded humanist optimized for friendly numeric display.
- **Numerals**: DM Sans with tabular figures for any tabular data (charts, lists); proportional for big hero numbers.
- **Fallback Stack**: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'SF Pro Rounded', 'SF Pro Display', 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`

### Hierarchy

| Role | Font | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Metric Hero | DM Sans | 44pt | 700 | 1.0 | -1.0pt | Big number inside steps ring / detail header |
| Screen Title | DM Sans | 32pt | 700 | 1.15 | -0.5pt | "Today", "Sleep" large nav title |
| Tile Value | DM Sans | 26pt | 700 | 1.0 | -0.5pt | The big number on each metric tile |
| Greeting | DM Sans | 22pt | 700 | 1.2 | -0.3pt | "Good morning, Maya" |
| Card Title | DM Sans | 18pt | 700 | 1.25 | -0.1pt | "Daily Readiness", "Sleep Score" |
| Body | DM Sans | 16pt | 400 | 1.5 | 0pt | Coaching copy, descriptions |
| Tile Value Inline | DM Sans | 15pt | 600 | 1.3 | 0pt | "68 bpm · Resting" |
| Label | DM Sans | 14pt | 400 | 1.4 | 0pt | "of 10,000 steps", metadata |
| Unit Suffix | DM Sans | 13pt | 600 | 1.0 | 0pt | "bpm", "min", "h" after a value |
| Caption / Chip | DM Sans | 12pt | 600 | 1.35 | 0.1pt | "Score 84 · Good", trend chips |
| Tab Label | DM Sans | 10pt | 600 | 1.0 | 0.1pt | Bottom tab labels |
| Button | DM Sans | 15pt | 700 | 1.0 | 0pt | Primary / secondary |

### Principles
- **The number is the hero**: hero metrics are 40–44pt bold with tight negative tracking — the loudest element on the card. Labels and units are deliberately quieter.
- **Warm, plain language**: greetings and coaching copy are sentence case, friendly, never clinical ("You're close!" not "Step goal: 78% complete").
- **Weight concentrated at 400 / 600 / 700**: body 400, sub-values/units 600, all titles & numbers 700. No thin, no black.
- **Tight tracking on display, normal on body**: big numbers and titles get negative letter-spacing for a modern feel; body stays at 0.
- **Units are subordinate**: a unit ("bpm", "min") is rendered ~half the size and a step lighter than its value, often baseline-aligned.
- **Dynamic Type**: greeting, card titles, body, labels scale; hero/tile numbers scale one step then truncate; tab labels and unit suffixes stay FIXED.

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 4pt
- Scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 40
- Screen horizontal inset: 20pt
- Card internal padding: 16–22pt; inter-card vertical gap: 16pt
- Tile grid gap: 12pt
- Greeting block to first card: 14pt

### Grid & Container
- iPhone: 20pt horizontal insets; cards are inset (not full-bleed) so rounded corners read
- Metric tiles: 2-column responsive grid
- iPad: multi-column tile grid (3–4 across); Today becomes a dashboard mosaic
- Charts: full-width within their card, 16pt internal padding

### Whitespace Philosophy
- **Cards as breathing stat objects**: every metric lives in its own generously-padded rounded card with air around it — nothing is edge-to-edge or cramped
- **The number gets space**: hero/tile numbers have generous internal padding so the big figure dominates
- **Rounded everything**: 16–24pt card radii and pill buttons create a soft, encouraging, non-clinical feel
- **Color does the grouping**: metric color (not borders or heavy dividers) ties a metric's tile, ring, and chart together

### Border Radius Scale
- Square (0pt): chart plot baselines, full-bleed dividers
- Subtle (8pt): small chips, metric icon chip (~7pt)
- Standard (12pt): inputs, small inner elements
- Tile (16–20pt): metric tiles, content cards
- Hero Card (24pt): steps-ring hero, large feature cards
- Pill (500pt): all buttons, search bar, segmented controls, trend chips
- Ring (50%): progress rings, score badges, avatars

## 6. Depth & Elevation

Fitbit is soft and mostly flat — depth comes from rounded surface tiles on the teal-black canvas plus very gentle shadows. The vibe is "calm and tactile," never harsh.

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Flat (Level 0) | No shadow; surface tile only | Most cards/tiles sit directly on canvas |
| Soft Card (Level 1) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.25) 0 4px 16px` | Feature cards, coaching banner |
| Floating (Level 2) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.35) 0 8px 24px` | Bottom sheets, log/edit modals |
| Sheet (Level 2) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.4) 0 -8px 28px` | Half-sheet pickers (set goal, log) |
| Modal Overlay | `rgba(0,4,8,0.6)` scrim | Behind modals & half-sheets |

**Shadow Philosophy**: Shadows are minimal and soft — they exist to lift sheets and the occasional feature card, never to outline every tile. On the teal-black canvas, color-coded tiles separate themselves by hue and the slightly lighter `#002A3A` surface, so shadows stay subtle. Floating sheets also get a 1pt `#143E50` border as a secondary cue.

### Motion
- **Ring fill**: on screen appear, the progress ring sweeps from 0 to its value over 900ms ease-out (a satisfying "draw"); on goal-hit it pulses once and triggers a visible feedback state + brief confetti
- **Number count-up**: hero/tile numbers count up from 0 to the value over ~700ms ease-out on first appearance
- **Card stagger-in**: Today cards fade + 8pt slide-up, staggered 40ms apart top-to-bottom
- **Tile tap**: tile scales 1.0 → 0.97 → 1.0 (120ms) then pushes to detail (300ms iOS push)
- **Trend chip**: appears with a tiny pop (scale 0.8 → 1.0, 180ms)
- **Sleep stage bar**: segments grow left-to-right in sequence on appear (600ms total)
- **Pull-to-refresh**: teal ring spinner; visible feedback state on trigger; cards re-stagger
- **Goal celebration**: full-screen confetti + a centered ring "complete" animation + visible feedback state when a daily goal is reached
- **Range switch (Day/Week/Month)**: chart cross-fades + bars re-grow over 400ms
- **Haptics**: soft success on goal hit, selection tick on range/segment change, light confirmation state on tile tap, celebratory notificationvisible feedback state on milestone

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use the deep teal-black canvas `#001017`/`#002A3A` — cyan undertone, not neutral gray
- Make Fitbit Teal `#00B0B9` the brand/steps/CTA; brighten to `#21D9CE` for text/links on dark
- Give every metric its fixed hue and keep it everywhere (tile, ring, chart, detail) — color is a mnemonic
- Make the big number the visual hero of every card (40–44pt bold, tight tracking)
- Use progress rings as the recurring shape language for goals
- Use generously rounded cards (16–24pt) and pill buttons — soft, encouraging
- Write warm, plain-language coaching copy ("You're close!", "Good to go")
- Animate the ring sweep + number count-up on appear; celebrate goal hits with confetti + visible feedback state
- Put deep ink (`#001017`) on teal buttons and metric-color chips — never white
- Use a trend chip in the metric color to show week-over-week change

### Don't
- Don't use a neutral-gray dark theme — the canvas must carry the teal cast
- Don't let metrics share or swap colors — sleep is always purple, HR always coral
- Don't make labels/units compete with the hero number — keep them quieter and smaller
- Don't use clinical phrasing ("78% goal completion") — Fitbit speaks like a kind coach
- Don't use sharp or small radii — cards are 16–24pt, buttons are full pills
- Don't put white text on the teal button or on metric-color chips (use deep ink)
- Don't draw heavy borders/shadows around every tile — hue + surface step does the separation
- Don't skip the ring-sweep / count-up animation — the "draw" is core to the feel
- Don't invert or recolor metric hues in light mode — they're identical across themes
- Don't bury the encouraging message — the kind line is as important as the number
- Don't use rectangular progress bars where Fitbit uses rings (steps, sleep, zone, readiness)

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Device Sizes
| Device | Width | Key Changes |
|--------|-------|-------------|

- "Build the Fitbit primary CTA: a `Capsule()`, `#00B0B9` background, deep-ink `#001017` DM Sans 15pt w700 text, 13pt vertical / 28pt horizontal padding, full-width 52pt on forms. Pressed: `#008A91` + scale 0.98."

### Iteration Guide
1. Canvas is deep teal-black `#001017`/`#002A3A` — cyan undertone, never neutral gray
2. Fitbit Teal `#00B0B9` is brand/steps/CTA; on dark, text & links use the brighter `#21D9CE`
3. Every metric owns a fixed hue everywhere: steps teal, HR coral `#FF6B81`, sleep purple `#7C5CFF`, readiness lime `#B8E986`, zone orange `#FF8A3D`, calories gold `#FFC233`
4. The big number is the hero of every card — 40–44pt bold, tight negative tracking
5. Progress rings are the recurring shape language (steps, sleep, zone, readiness)
6. Cards are generously rounded (16–24pt), buttons are full pills — soft & encouraging
7. Coaching copy is warm and plain ("You're close!"), never clinical percentages
8. Sweep the ring + count up the number on appear; celebrate goal hits with confetti + a visible feedback state
9. Deep ink `#001017` goes on teal buttons and metric chips — never white
10. Metric hues are identical in light mode; the light theme only swaps canvas (`#FFFFFF`) and text (`#0B2A33`)

## React/Web Adaptation

- Implement the mobile information architecture as responsive React/Web UI.
- Use familiar web-accessible icons with equivalent meaning; platform-exclusive symbol names are source evidence, not implementation requirements.
- Express tactile or native feedback as visible pressed, loading, success, error, or motion states when the browser cannot provide an equivalent API.
- Preserve minimum touch target, safe-area, compact-density, bottom-navigation, and gesture intent using web capabilities.

## Provenance and Evidence

- Source repository: https://github.com/meliwat/awesome-ios-design-md
- Upstream commit: 5d3aeca239caef3ea4080034eb22ab87cc77fa24
- License: MIT
- Observed facts: values explicitly present in the framework-neutral upstream DESIGN.md and README.
- Inferences: React/Web adaptations identified as adaptations, not upstream facts.

## Known Gaps

- Native haptic APIs, platform-exclusive icon glyphs, and unverified device-specific motion are not Axhub implementation requirements.
- Brand behavior may change after the pinned upstream revision; revalidation requires a new commit pin and review record.
