# Design System Inspiration of WhatsApp (iOS)

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

WhatsApp's iOS app is a utility-first messenger dressed in a narrow, signature palette of green, teal, and white. The interface is aggressively native: tabbed bottom navigation, stock SF Pro typography, web-accessible icon throughout, iOS-native swipe gestures, and native share sheets. WhatsApp has never tried to be a "platform" in the Instagram sense — it has tried to be the phone's SMS replacement, and the UI reflects that goal with near-monastic restraint. The app disappears, the message bubble is the hero.

The signature color moment is a two-stop green system: WhatsApp Green (`#25D366`) on the send button, floating action button, active read-receipt tick, and the voice-message record ring; and WhatsApp Teal (`#075E54`) as the legacy brand accent seen on link tints, the QR code screen, and the Meta-era "WhatsApp" brand chrome. Outgoing chat bubbles sit on a specific mint-leaf tint (`#D9FDD3` light mode, `#005C4B` dark mode), a color so load-bearing that it is immediately recognizable even as a single decontextualized pixel. Incoming bubbles are a neutral white/gray that fades into the wallpaper. The chat canvas itself carries a subtle doodle wallpaper by default — an optional cream pattern in light mode and a near-black dark-mode variant — that makes a busy chat feel warm rather than utilitarian.

Typography is pure SF Pro. WhatsApp ships no proprietary font; instead it leans on iOS Dynamic Type so aggressively that every label, timestamp, and bubble text scales up to accessibility sizes without breaking layout. Contact names in the chat list are 17pt semibold, message previews are 15pt regular in secondary gray, bubble text is 17pt regular, timestamps are 12pt regular. The typographic restraint is deliberate: this is a messenger built for a billion daily users across every literacy level and device generation, so the type system defers to whatever the OS wants to render.

**Key Characteristics:**
- WhatsApp Green (`#25D366`) reserved for send / voice-record / positive status — the verb color
- Teal (`#075E54`) as the legacy brand tint — QR code, link highlights, Meta-era chrome
- Mint-leaf outgoing chat bubble (`#D9FDD3` light / `#005C4B` dark) — iconic enough to pixel-identify
- Tabbed bottom navigation (2024+): Updates / Calls / Communities / Chats / Settings
- Voice message waveform as a signature interactive component with playback-synced bar fill
- Blue double-check read receipts — the universal "seen" signal
- End-to-end encryption lock symbol on every chat header — trust as UI
- Native SF Pro + web-accessible icon everywhere — WhatsApp defers to iOS conventions
- Light / Dark / Auto themes; wallpaper customization per chat
- Status ring (green) around contact avatars with active Status updates

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Primary
- **WhatsApp Green** (`#25D366`): The send color — send button, FAB, active mic record ring, read-receipt "sent" green (before double-blue), phone-call answer button.
- **Green Pressed** (`#1EBE5D`): Pressed / active state for green CTAs.
- **Teal** (`#075E54`): Legacy brand accent — QR screen, business-account badge, link highlights in some older screens.
- **Mid Teal** (`#128C7E`): Secondary brand — used for outgoing bubble text accent, checkmark ticks pre-read.
- **Dark Teal** (`#054D44`): Deep brand chrome — rare, seen on splash and some dark-mode backgrounds.

### Chat Bubbles
- **Outgoing Bubble (Light)** (`#D9FDD3`): The mint-leaf tint on your own messages.
- **Outgoing Bubble (Dark)** (`#005C4B`): Dark-mode outgoing — deep teal-green.
- **Incoming Bubble (Light)** (`#FFFFFF`): Pure white on the wallpaper canvas.
- **Incoming Bubble (Dark)** (`#1F2C34`): A muted blue-gray that reads as "paper" in dark mode.
- **Reply Strip** (`#06CF9C` or `#25D366` 30% tint): The vertical accent bar on a quoted-reply preview inside a bubble.

### Canvas & Surfaces
- **Chat Wallpaper (Light)** (`#ECE5DD`): The iconic cream doodle-wallpaper background — modifiable per chat.
- **Chat Wallpaper (Dark)** (`#0B141A`): Default dark wallpaper — a deep blue-black.
- **App Canvas (Light)** (`#FFFFFF`): Chat list and settings screens.
- **App Canvas (Dark)** (`#111B21`): Primary dark canvas — a slight blue tint, not true black.
- **Surface 1 (Light)** (`#F7F8FA`): Section group background on Settings.
- **Surface 1 (Dark)** (`#202C33`): Elevated surface — input bar background, reply strip.
- **Surface 2 (Dark)** (`#2A3942`): Higher elevation — system messages, pinned bar, context menus.
- **Divider (Light)** (`#E9EDEF`): Hairline between chat list rows.
- **Divider (Dark)** (`#222D34`): Dark-mode hairline.

### Text
- **Text Primary (Light)** (`#111B21`): Bubble text, contact names, screen titles.
- **Text Secondary (Light)** (`#667781`): Message preview, timestamps, section subtitles.
- **Text Tertiary (Light)** (`#8696A0`): Placeholder, disabled labels.
- **Text Primary (Dark)** (`#E9EDEF`): Bubble text and titles in dark mode.
- **Text Secondary (Dark)** (`#8696A0`): Message preview in dark mode.
- **Timestamp in-Bubble** (`#667781` light / `#8696A0` dark): The time stamp inside an outgoing or incoming bubble.

### Semantic
- **Read Blue** (`#53BDEB`): The double blue ticks — read receipt. This is THE most semantically loaded color in the app.
- **Sent Gray** (`#8696A0`): Single gray tick — sent but not delivered.
- **Delivered Gray** (`#8696A0`): Double gray ticks — delivered but not read.
- **Error Red** (`#F15C6D`): Failed-to-send bubble tint, delete chat confirmation.
- **Record Red** (`#F15C6D`): Voice-record active ring (rare — WhatsApp uses green here, red is reserved for in-recording decibel meter overflow).
- **Status Ring Green** (`#25D366`): The ring around avatars with active, unread Status updates.
- **Status Ring Gray** (`#8696A0`): Status ring for viewed statuses.
- **Verified Green Check** (`#25D366`): Official business badge checkmark.

### Dark Mode
WhatsApp's dark mode is a blue-black utility — it's not true black (that would bleach the mint-leaf bubble) and it's not quite gray (that would lose the WhatsApp feel). It's `#0B141A` on the chat wallpaper and `#111B21` on the app canvas.
- All accent colors retain their light-mode hex; brand greens stay bright.
- The outgoing bubble shifts from mint-leaf to deep teal-green (`#005C4B`) for contrast.
- Input bar background becomes `#202C33` to sit above the wallpaper.

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family
- **Primary**: `SF Pro Text` (body) and `SF Pro Display` (titles) — Apple's stock system fonts. WhatsApp ships no proprietary typeface.
- **Fallback Stack**: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'SF Pro Text', 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`
- **Monospace (rare)**: `SF Mono` — used only in formatted code blocks inside bubbles (triple-backtick Markdown formatting).
- **Non-Latin**: Full Dynamic Type support across all iOS-supported scripts. WhatsApp relies entirely on OS font substitution.

### Hierarchy

| Role | Font | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Large Title (Chats) | SF Pro Display | 34pt | 700 | 1.12 | 0.37pt | "Chats" scroll-collapsing large title |
| Screen Title | SF Pro Display | 17pt | 600 | 1.18 | -0.4pt | Nav bar title when collapsed |
| Contact Name (Chat List) | SF Pro Text | 17pt | 600 | 1.23 | -0.4pt | Contact in chat list row |
| Message Preview | SF Pro Text | 15pt | 400 | 1.33 | -0.2pt | Last message preview below name |
| Bubble Body | SF Pro Text | 17pt | 400 | 1.29 | -0.4pt | The message text inside a chat bubble |
| Bubble Sender (Group) | SF Pro Text | 13pt | 600 | 1.23 | -0.1pt | Sender name in group chat, colored |
| Timestamp (List) | SF Pro Text | 12pt | 400 | 1.2 | 0pt | Relative time on chat-list rows |
| Timestamp (Bubble) | SF Pro Text | 11pt | 400 | 1.0 | 0pt | In-bubble time in secondary gray |
| Section Header | SF Pro Text | 13pt | 600 | 1.2 | -0.1pt | "PINNED", "ARCHIVED" — uppercase tracked |
| System Message | SF Pro Text | 12pt | 500 | 1.3 | 0pt | "Messages are end-to-end encrypted" center pill |
| Tab Label | SF Pro Text | 10pt | 500 | 1.0 | 0.1pt | Bottom tab labels |
| Button (Primary) | SF Pro Text | 17pt | 600 | 1.0 | -0.4pt | "Continue", "Next" — native iOS button type |
| Input Placeholder | SF Pro Text | 16pt | 400 | 1.3 | -0.3pt | "Message" placeholder in compose bar |
| Settings Row | SF Pro Text | 17pt | 400 | 1.23 | -0.4pt | Settings row title |
| Settings Detail | SF Pro Text | 15pt | 400 | 1.3 | -0.2pt | Value on right side of settings row |

### Principles
- **Defer to iOS**: WhatsApp follows Apple Human Interface Guidelines type sizes almost exactly — large titles, native body, footnote.
- **Dynamic Type first**: Every body/preview/bubble text scales with user preference. Layout wraps gracefully up to Accessibility XL.
- **Weight used sparingly**: 400 for body, 600 for names/titles, 700 only on large titles. No 800, no 300.
- **Color contrast matters more than size**: Message preview (15pt gray) and contact name (17pt black) rely on color weight differentiation, not typographic scale.
- **Sender color in groups**: In group chats each sender's name is tinted in one of ~20 pre-assigned colors to aid scanning.
- **Timestamps shrink to fit**: When an outgoing bubble has short text, the timestamp floats inside the last line; for long messages it drops below.

## 4. Component Stylings

- Focus: tiny cancel button slides in trailing

### Distinctive Components

**Voice Message Waveform Bubble**
The signature WhatsApp interactive component. A voice message rendered as a horizontal waveform inside the bubble.
- Height: ~52pt bubble total
- Leading: play/pause circle (36pt, `#25D366` background, white `play.fill` / `pause.fill`)
- Center: waveform — ~40-60 vertical bars, each 2pt wide with 2pt spacing
- Bar color: played bars = `#25D366` (or `#128C7E` in teal-heavy legacy), unplayed bars = `#8696A0`
- Bar heights: variable per actual audio amplitude (2-20pt range)
- Trailing: duration "0:23" 11pt `#8696A0`, below that a speed pill "1x" / "1.5x" / "2x" when playing
- Avatar dot (tiny): for group voice messages, the sender's avatar sits just above the waveform
- Haptics: soft tick when playback reaches each "amplitude peak" bar (subtle)

**Status Ring (Around Avatar)**
- Diameter: avatar + 6pt outer ring
- Ring width: 2.5pt
- Ring color: `#25D366` if unviewed status updates exist; `#8696A0` if all viewed
- Segmentation: if multiple status updates, ring breaks into N arc segments with 4-degree gaps
- Animation on tap: ring fills progress as viewer scrubs through statuses

**Read Receipts (Tick Row)**
- Single gray tick (`#8696A0`) = sent to server
- Double gray tick = delivered to device
- Double blue tick (`#53BDEB`) = read
- Position: inline with timestamp at bottom-right of outgoing bubble
- Size: 14pt check marks, tightly kerned so they overlap slightly
- Animation: blue ticks animate in with a slight fade when the other party opens the message

**End-to-End Encryption Lock Banner**
- Center pill in chat canvas, 1pt shadow, `#FFF5C4` (light) / `#1F2C34` (dark) background
- web-accessible icon `lock.fill` 12pt + "Messages are end-to-end encrypted. No one outside this chat..."
- 12pt text weight 500, `#54636D`
- Appears as first message in every new chat

**View-Once Media Indicator**
- Circular "1" badge in the corner of media preview in chat bubble
- After viewing: bubble collapses to "You opened" or "Opened" text with ghost-eye web-accessible icon

**Emoji Reaction Palette**
- 6 default emojis: heart, thumbs-up, laugh, surprise, cry, pray — plus "+" for custom
- Palette: horizontal floating capsule above the message on long-press
- Background: `#FFFFFF` light / `#2A3942` dark with soft shadow
- Emoji size: 32pt, spacing 8pt
- On selection: emoji flies down onto bottom-right of bubble as a small 14pt chip
- Haptic: soft impact on selection

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 4pt
- Scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 44, 56, 72
- Standard screen margin: 16pt horizontal
- Chat bubble margin from screen edge: 8pt (tighter than app canvas)
- Between chat bubbles (same sender): 2pt; different sender: 8pt

### Grid & Container
- Content width: full device width
- Chat canvas width: full bleed; bubbles constrained to 80% max width
- Settings list: full width with 16pt horizontal padding inside rows

### Whitespace Philosophy
- **Density tuned for browsing**: Chat list rows at 72pt are comfortable; bubble padding at 8-12pt is tight enough for a rapid-fire conversation.
- **Wallpaper as negative space**: The cream/dark doodle wallpaper is visible between bubbles — it's not empty, it's atmospheric.
- **No decorative padding**: Every pixel does a job. Avatars are 40-48pt, buttons are sized to their content.

### Border Radius Scale
- Square (0pt): Status segment arcs (rare), media thumbnails can be 0pt in grid
- Soft (4pt): Media previews inside bubble
- Standard (10pt): Search bar, section group cards, settings row corners
- Bubble (12pt): Chat bubbles — 12pt on all corners except the tail corner (0pt)
- Comfortable (16pt): Onboarding CTAs, bottom sheet grabber handles
- Pill (20-24pt): Compose input field, filter chips
- Full Circle (50%): Avatars, mic button, send button, status ring

## 6. Depth & Elevation

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Flat (0) | No shadow | Chat list rows, settings rows, bubbles on wallpaper |
| Bubble (1) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.08) 0 1px 2px` | Subtle shadow under chat bubbles, extremely soft |
| Card (2) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.12) 0 2px 8px` | Reaction palette floating menu |
| Sheet (3) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.2) 0 -12px 32px` | Bottom action sheet, attachment tray |
| Modal Overlay | `rgba(0,0,0,0.4)` backdrop | Long-press overlay, dimming behind reactions sheet |
| Nav Blur | `translucent backdrop blur` 92% opacity | Top nav bar and bottom tab bar |

**Shadow Philosophy**: Shadows are extremely restrained. The bubble itself has at most a 1-2pt shadow to separate it from the wallpaper, and only reaction/attachment popovers lift noticeably. The app feels flat, mirroring iOS's own aesthetic.

### Motion
- **Send button press**: Scale 0.92 → 1.0 spring + visible feedback state
- **Mic record hold**: Ring pulses outward 1.0 → 1.2 with decibel-responsive scale
- **Message send**: Bubble slides up from compose bar, ticks animate in after 300ms latency
- **Read receipt update**: Ticks cross-fade from gray to blue over 200ms
- **Swipe-to-reply**: Native iOS-style 60fps horizontal drag, visible feedback state tick at threshold
- **Reaction tap**: Emoji scales 1.0 → 1.2 → 1.0 with visible feedback state
- **Voice playback**: Waveform bars progressively fill green left-to-right synced to audio
- **Status ring fill**: Circular progress animates during status viewing (linear)

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use `#25D366` (WhatsApp Green) for send, answer-call, record, and positive primary actions
- Use `#D9FDD3` (light) or `#005C4B` (dark) for outgoing bubbles — the mint-leaf is iconic
- Keep bubble tails asymmetric — rounded all corners except one pointed at sender
- Rely on Dynamic Type; never hardcode pt sizes that won't scale
- Use SF Pro + web-accessible icon as your default — WhatsApp looks native because it IS native
- Use blue double ticks (`#53BDEB`) for read receipts — this is universally understood
- Use the lock icon for end-to-end encryption indicators — the semantic weight matters
- Show the encryption banner as the first message in every new chat
- Blur the top nav and bottom tab bar with `translucent backdrop blur`
- Use green status rings for unread, gray for viewed status updates

### Don't
- Don't use pure black canvas — WhatsApp dark mode is `#111B21`, a blue-black
- Don't round bubble corners equally — the asymmetric tail is core to the form language
- Don't use red for send or positive actions — red is reserved for delete, fail, and call-decline
- Don't place the "new chat" FAB inside the tab bar — keep it as a nav-bar trailing icon
- Don't add custom fonts — WhatsApp's iOS typography is pure SF Pro
- Don't use gradients on UI chrome — WhatsApp is flat color
- Don't hide the timestamp inside bubbles at small sizes — users scan bubbles for recency
- Don't use green text — green is structural (send, answer, read, status ring), not decorative
- Don't break out of native iOS swipe-actions for row gestures
- Don't use heavy shadows — WhatsApp is aggressively flat

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Device Sizes
| Device | Width | Key Changes |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| iPhone SE (3rd gen) | 375pt | Bubble max-width shrinks to 78%; waveform loses ~5 bars |
| iPhone 13/14/15 | 390pt | Standard bubble 80% max-width |
| iPhone 15/16 Pro | 393pt | Dynamic Island accommodated in calls nav |
| iPhone 15/16 Pro Max | 430pt | Bubble 80%; avatar grows to 52pt in chat list |
| iPad | 768pt+ | Split view: chat list left, conversation right |

### Dynamic Type
- Bubble body, chat-list name and preview: full scale up to Accessibility XL
- Timestamps (11-12pt): fixed size to preserve inline layout
- Tab labels: fixed 10pt
- Bubble auto-wraps at any scale; bubble max-width shrinks with XL sizes

### Orientation
- Chat list / Updates / Settings: **portrait-locked** on iPhone
- Video calls: **rotate to landscape**
- Media viewer (photos / videos inside chat): **rotate to landscape**
- iPad: all orientations supported; split view adapts to landscape width

### Touch Targets
- Send button: 36pt in compose bar (native iOS minimum-plus hit target)
- Mic button: same 36pt circle, 44pt effective hit area with hitSlop
- Chat list row: 72pt height, full-row tappable
- Swipe actions: native iOS swipe width, 80pt per action
- Reaction emojis in palette: 32pt glyph, 44pt effective

### Safe Area Handling
- Top: safe area honored; call screen extends into Dynamic Island with pill treatment
- Bottom: compose bar floats above safe area; keyboard pushes content up natively
- Sides: 16pt on app canvas, 8pt on chat canvas for bubble alignment

Leading 36pt #25D366 play circle with white play.fill, horizontal waveform of 50 bars (2pt wide, 2pt gap) with variable 2-20pt heights. Played bars #25D366, unplayed #8696A0. Trailing duration '0:23' in 11pt #8696A0 and a '1x' speed pill."
- "Create a responsive React/Web bar: pill-shaped multiline input with 20pt radius, background #FFFFFF on a #F0F2F5 light canvas (or #202C33 on dark), placeholder 'Message' 16pt #8696A0. Leading emoji web-accessible icon 'face.smiling' 24pt #8696A0. Trailing camera web-accessible icon 'camera.fill' 24pt and the 36pt #25D366 send/mic morph button."
- "Design the WhatsApp bottom tab bar: Updates, Calls, Communities, Chats, Settings — 24pt web-accessible icon icons (bubble.left.and.bubble.right.fill for Communities, message.fill for Chats). Active tint #25D366, inactive #8696A0. Labels SF Pro 10pt weight 500. Blur background translucent backdrop blur over #FFFFFF / #111B21 at 92% opacity."

### Iteration Guide
1. Canvas is `#FFFFFF` (light) / `#111B21` (dark) — the dark is a blue-black, NOT pure black
2. Chat wallpaper is SEPARATE from app canvas — `#ECE5DD` cream (light) / `#0B141A` deep (dark)
3. Outgoing bubbles are `#D9FDD3` / `#005C4B` — this is THE signature pixel of WhatsApp
4. Bubble corner radius is 12pt on all corners EXCEPT the tail (0pt on bottom-trailing for outgoing, bottom-leading for incoming)
5. WhatsApp Green `#25D366` only for send / answer-call / voice-record / status-ring / read-tick green — never decorative
6. Blue double check (`#53BDEB`) is a LOAD-BEARING color — do not repurpose
7. Typography is pure SF Pro — NO custom fonts; weights 400, 500, 600, 700 only
8. Dynamic Type is respected everywhere except inline timestamps (11-12pt fixed)
9. Read receipts use tiny 12-14pt overlapping check marks, not separate dots
10. End-to-end encryption banner is THE first message in every new chat — don't skip it

## React/Web Adaptation

- Implement the mobile information architecture as responsive React/Web UI.
- Use familiar web-accessible icons with equivalent meaning; platform-exclusive symbol names are source evidence, not implementation requirements.
- Express tactile or native feedback as visible pressed, loading, success, error, or motion states when the browser cannot provide an equivalent API.
- Preserve minimum touch target, safe-area, compact-density, bottom-navigation, and gesture intent using web capabilities.

## Provenance and Evidence

- Source repository: https://github.com/meliwat/awesome-ios-design-md
- Upstream commit: 5d3aeca239caef3ea4080034eb22ab87cc77fa24
- License: MIT
- Observed facts: values explicitly present in the framework-neutral upstream DESIGN.md and README.
- Inferences: React/Web adaptations identified as adaptations, not upstream facts.

## Known Gaps

- Native haptic APIs, platform-exclusive icon glyphs, and unverified device-specific motion are not Axhub implementation requirements.
- Brand behavior may change after the pinned upstream revision; revalidation requires a new commit pin and review record.
