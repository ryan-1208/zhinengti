# Design System Inspiration of Google Maps (iOS)

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

Google Maps' iOS app is a pure map-first interface — the earth is the canvas and the UI is a handful of floating shapes laid over it. Unlike most apps that treat the map as a feature, Maps treats the map as the entire product: every search result, every place card, every navigation instruction exists as a translucent sheet or rounded pill stationed over rendered geography. The result is a chrome-light surface where road vectors, park polygons, and water bodies do all the visual heavy lifting, and the UI chrome melts into whatever landscape is beneath it. This is why a Maps screenshot taken in Manhattan looks chromatically different from one taken in Yosemite — the app is tinted by the terrain.

The accent system is a disciplined deployment of Google's four-color identity. Google Blue (`#4285F4`) is the operating accent — it marks the route polyline, the "Your location" dot with its soft accuracy halo, the "Directions" floating action button, the active tab, and any pin placed on a "home" or "work" saved place. The three remaining Google logo colors each have a single semantic job: Red (`#EA4335`) is the default pin color for a dropped/searched place (the one most users recognize as "the Google Maps pin"), Green (`#34A853`) marks saved or favorited places, Yellow (`#FBBC04`) flags alerts, construction, and caution overlays. Orange (`#FB8C00`) is used for category pins (restaurants, gas stations, hotels). Beyond these, color appears only in map tiles — park green `#C8E6C9`, water blue `#AADAFF`, highway shield yellow `#FDF6E3`, neutral building fills `#F0F0F0`.

Typography is Google Sans for headings and Roboto for body — Google's unified two-font system across its app ecosystem. Google Sans carries geometric, open, slightly humanist shapes that feel neutral on any locale; Roboto is flatter, optimized for dense UI copy and address display. The hierarchy is conservative: place card titles at 20pt weight 500, addresses in 14pt Roboto weight 400, distances in tabular numerals so "1.2 mi" and "14.7 mi" stack cleanly in a list. Turn-by-turn navigation breaks the quiet rule — the turn card shoots to 36-48pt display type in Google Sans weight 700 so the next maneuver is legible at a glance behind the wheel.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Map is the hero — full-bleed to every edge, UI floats as translucent sheets and pills
- Google Blue (`#4285F4`) as the operating accent — route line, location dot, Directions FAB
- Four-color pin system: Red (default), Green (saved), Blue (home/work), Orange (category)
- Floating top search bar ("Search here") with voice-mic and profile avatar
- Bottom sheet drawer with drag-to-expand detents — search results, place details, transit
- Category chip row (Restaurants / Hotels / Coffee / Things to do) beneath the search bar
- Blue "Your location" dot with translucent accuracy circle and heading cone
- Blue route polyline (5pt) with darker blue casing for legibility on any map color
- Turn-by-turn immersive mode: giant blue arrow, top turn card, bottom ETA, speed chip
- Dark mode uses `#202124` canvas with the map's dark-tile palette

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Primary (Google Logo Colors)
- **Google Blue** (`#4285F4`): Primary UI accent, route polyline, "Your location" dot, Directions FAB, active tab indicator, home/work pin.
- **Google Red** (`#EA4335`): Default pin color for searched/dropped places, the iconic Maps pin.
- **Google Yellow** (`#FBBC04`): Alerts, construction icons, speed trap overlays, caution chips.
- **Google Green** (`#34A853`): Saved/favorited place pins, "on-time" transit, success states.

- **Blue Halo** (`rgba(66,133,244,0.18)`): Accuracy circle around "Your location" dot, selection pill backgrounds.

### Canvas & Text (Light Mode)
- **Canvas White** (`#FFFFFF`): Bottom sheet surface, search bar fill, card backgrounds below the map.
- **Surface Muted** (`#F1F3F4`): Category chip fill, disabled fill, sectional backgrounds.
- **Divider** (`#DADCE0`): Hairline dividers between list rows and tabs.

- **Text Tertiary** (`#80868B`): Low-emphasis labels, disabled text.

### Map Tile Palette (Light)
- **Road White** (`#FFFFFF`): Street surface.
- **Highway Yellow** (`#FDF6E3`): Major highways, freeways — the signature faint-yellow strip.
- **Water Blue** (`#AADAFF`): Lakes, rivers, ocean.
- **Park Green** (`#C8E6C9`): Parks, green spaces.
- **Building Fill** (`#F0F0F0`): Building footprints at zoom, with `#E0E0E0` outline.
- **Land Neutral** (`#F5F5F5`): Default land tint between roads.

### Dark Mode

- **Traffic Orange** (`#FB8C00`): Slow traffic segment overlay.
- **Traffic Green** (`#0F9D58`): Clear traffic segment overlay.
- **Alert Yellow** (`#FBBC04`): Construction, caution triangles.
- **Transit Pink** (`#E63946`): Metro/subway line colors are city-specific; the default catch is a warm red.

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family
- **Headings / Display**: `Google Sans` (geometric, slightly humanist — used for place titles, turn directions, tab headers)
- **Body / UI**: `Roboto` (dense, optimized for UI — used for addresses, list metadata, body copy)
- **Fallback Stack**: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'SF Pro Text', 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`
- **Numerals**: Roboto tabular figures for distances, ETA, speed
- **CJK / Non-Latin**: Noto Sans family siblings fall back for every script Google ships

### Hierarchy

| Role | Font | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Navigation Turn | Google Sans | 36pt | 700 | 1.1 | -0.4pt | "Turn right onto Main St" in driving mode |
| Screen Title | Google Sans | 28pt | 500 | 1.15 | -0.3pt | "Your places", "Settings" hero |
| Place Title (Card) | Google Sans | 20pt | 500 | 1.2 | -0.2pt | Place sheet hero title |
| Section Header | Google Sans | 16pt | 500 | 1.25 | -0.1pt | "Photos", "Reviews", "About" |
| Row Title | Roboto | 16pt | 500 | 1.3 | 0pt | Search result row title |
| Body | Roboto | 14pt | 400 | 1.4 | 0pt | Place description, review text |
| Address | Roboto | 14pt | 400 | 1.35 | 0pt | Street address line, monospaced digits |
| Meta / Distance | Roboto | 13pt | 400 | 1.3 | 0pt | "1.2 mi · 4 min · Open now" |
| Rating | Roboto | 14pt | 500 | 1.2 | 0pt | "4.5 ★ (2,345)" — bold rating, lighter count |
| Category Chip | Google Sans | 14pt | 500 | 1.0 | 0pt | "Restaurants", "Coffee" |
| Button (Primary) | Google Sans | 16pt | 500 | 1.0 | 0pt | "Directions", "Save" |
| Button (Secondary) | Google Sans | 14pt | 500 | 1.0 | 0pt | "Call", "Share", "Start" |
| Tab Label | Google Sans | 11pt | 500 | 1.0 | 0.2pt | Tab bar labels |
| ETA / Speed | Roboto | 16pt | 500 | 1.0 | 0pt | Navigation ETA, speed chip |
| Distance Pill | Roboto | 13pt | 500 | 1.0 | 0pt | Map distance labels at route apex |

### Principles
- **Two-font system**: Google Sans for headlines and CTAs, Roboto for everything dense and data-driven. Never swap them.
- **Weights concentrated at 400 / 500 / 700**: Regular, Medium, Bold. 500 is the workhorse weight; 700 is reserved for nav turn cards and emphasis.
- **Tabular numerals always**: distances, ratings, ETAs, speeds use Roboto's tabular figure set so columns align.
- **Rating star uses Google Yellow**: `#FBBC04` (not orange) — consistent with Google product rating stars.
- **Turn card type is the only display moment**: 36-48pt, Google Sans 700, reserved for in-navigation mode.
- **No italics**: emphasis through weight only.

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 4pt
- Scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 56, 72
- Map-relative margins: 16pt from screen edges for floating controls and search bar
- Sheet internal: 16pt horizontal, 20pt top (below grabber), 24pt bottom above safe area
- Gaps inside place sheet: 16pt between sections, 12pt between action buttons

### Grid & Container
- Map: full viewport, edge-to-edge, underneath Dynamic Island and status bar
- Floating search bar: 16pt horizontal margin, pill shape
- Category chip row: starts 16pt below search bar, peek-edge right side
- Bottom sheet: full-width, attached bottom, floats with 16pt top radius
- Map controls: stacked trailing edge, 16pt from edge, offset above current sheet detent

### Whitespace Philosophy
- **Map is king**: 60-85% of viewport, always. The UI exists to yield to geography.
- **Pills and sheets don't touch**: 16pt between any two floating elements to preserve map breathability.
- **Place cards breathe**: 16pt padding inside, 24pt between sections.
- **Turn cards are dense by necessity**: navigation mode's UI is denser to fit every detail needed at speed.

### Border Radius Scale
- Square (0pt): Map tiles (they are the geometry itself)
- Soft (8pt): Inline badges, small status pills
- Standard (12pt): Place thumbnails, photo tiles, inner card surfaces
- Comfortable (16pt): Bottom sheet top, turn cards, ETA card
- Pill (18-24pt): Chips, secondary buttons, primary pill CTAs
- Full Pill (full): Top floating search bar, category chips
- Circle (50%): FAB, location dot, avatar, map controls

## 6. Depth & Elevation

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Flat (Level 0) | No shadow | Map tiles, map pins (rely on ground shadow) |
| Hairline (Level 1) | 1pt `#DADCE0` border | Category chips (default), segmented controls |
| Floating Pill (Level 2) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.15) 0 2px 8px` | Top search bar, distance labels on map |
| Floating Control (Level 3) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.15) 0 2px 6px` | Map control buttons (recenter, layers, compass) |
| FAB (Level 4) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.2) 0 4px 12px` | Directions FAB |
| Bottom Sheet (Level 5) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.12) 0 -4px 20px` | Bottom drawer for search results and place detail |
| Turn Card (Level 6) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.2) 0 4px 16px` | Navigation top turn card on blue |
| Dim Overlay | `rgba(0,0,0,0.5)` | Behind modal sheets (route alternatives) |

**Shadow Philosophy**: Because every piece of UI sits on top of a textured, colored map, shadows need to separate "UI plane" from "map plane" without overpowering the geography. A 15% black shadow at 8pt blur reads cleanly against both park-green and ocean-blue tiles. The FAB's shadow is the most aggressive (20% / 12pt) because the button is the primary action and must lift cleanly above any terrain. Map pins get a ground-hugging ellipse shadow instead of a drop — this is what makes them feel dropped into the world rather than placed on a canvas.

### Motion
- **Pin drop**: 0.35s spring with overshoot 1.1 → 1.0, shadow scales up with pin, visible feedback state
- **Search bar expand to full screen**: 0.28s ease-out, pill morphs into full-width search panel with list fade-in
- **Bottom sheet detent change**: 0.35s spring, damping 0.85 — snaps cleanly between collapsed/medium/expanded
- **FAB press**: scale 0.95 → 1.0 spring (damping 0.7), paired with `medium-emphasis confirmation state` visible feedback state
- **Route draw on start**: polyline traces from origin to destination over 600ms ease-out, then camera pans to follow
- **Location dot pulse**: continuous 1.8s ease-in-out scale 1.0 → 1.15 → 1.0
- **Turn card swap**: slides up from below, previous card fades to 0, 300ms ease-in-out, visible feedback state on arrival at each turn
- **Camera flyTo on recenter**: 0.6s ease-in-out, novisible feedback state (soft action)
- **Traffic overlay fade-in**: 400ms ease-out as traffic data loads
- **Dark mode cross-fade**: map tiles cross-fade over 1.2s on system theme toggle

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Keep the map at 60%+ of viewport on every primary screen — it's the product
- Use Google Blue (`#4285F4`) for the route polyline, location dot, and Directions FAB
- Float the top search bar as a pill with 16pt margins and a soft shadow
- Render the bottom sheet with 16pt top corners, visible grabber, three detents
- Use the four-color pin system: Red default, Green saved, Blue home/work, Orange category
- Use Google Sans for titles and CTAs, Roboto for body and metadata (tabular numerals on data)
- Display traffic as colored overlay on the route: red heavy, orange slow, green clear
- Trigger visible feedback state on pin drop and "Start navigation"; visible feedback state on tab change
- Show the accuracy circle around the location dot — it's the trust signal
- Use `#202124` canvas in dark mode with the dark-map tile palette

### Don't
- Don't color the map itself with brand colors — the map uses its own tile palette
- Don't round map pins heavily — the tear-drop shape with 3pt white inner dot is the silhouette
- Don't drop pin shadows — use a ground-hugging ellipse for on-world feel
- Don't animate the map aggressively — camera moves are 0.3-0.6s ease, never snap
- Don't stack more than 3 floating map controls trailing edge — it clutters the map
- Don't use red (`#EA4335`) for generic UI actions — it reads as a pin or destructive
- Don't override tabular numerals for distances — columns must align
- Don't hide the bottom sheet when a route is active — the ETA card must remain visible
- Don't center-align body text in place cards — Maps content is left-aligned (LTR)
- Don't introduce new accent colors — the four Google logo colors each have a job already

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Device Sizes
| Device | Width | Key Changes |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| iPhone SE (3rd gen) | 375pt | Category chip row fits 4 visible, bottom sheet collapsed 120pt |
| iPhone 13/14/15 | 390pt | Standard 5 visible chips, 140pt collapsed sheet |
| iPhone 15/16 Pro | 393pt | Dynamic Island pushes search bar 8pt lower |
| iPhone 15/16 Pro Max | 430pt | 6 visible chips, turn card scales to 180pt tall in nav mode |
| iPad | 768pt+ | Map full-bleed; sheet becomes a 420pt floating panel anchored leading side |

### Dynamic Type
- Place titles, addresses, row titles: full scale
- Navigation turn instruction: scales to 48pt max
- Distance/ETA labels: fixed size (layout-sensitive)
- Speed chip: fixed size
- Tab labels: scale up to 13pt, then truncate

### Orientation
- Explore / Saved / Updates: **portrait-locked**
- Navigation mode: **rotates to landscape** — turn card moves to top, ETA to bottom-right, map expands horizontally
- Street View: **rotates freely** — 360° horizontal pan works best with device orientation

### Touch Targets
- Directions FAB: 56pt (hero action)
- Top search bar: 48pt tall, full-row tappable
- Category chips: 36pt tall with 44pt effective hit
- Map pins: 40pt hit area despite 32pt visual
- Map controls: 40pt visible, 44pt hit
- Tab bar icons: 24pt icon inside 44pt hit

### Safe Area Handling
- Top: search bar floats 8pt below safe area top
- Bottom: sheet extends to home indicator; content padded 24pt above indicator
- Dynamic Island: search bar sits 8pt below the island bottom edge
- Sides: map edge-to-edge; floating controls 16pt inset

### Example Component Prompts
- "Create a responsive React/Web Google Maps top search bar: floats 8pt below safe area with 16pt horizontal margins, 48pt tall pill (full corner radius), `#FFFFFF` background, `rgba(0,0,0,0.15) 0 2px 8px` shadow. Leading 28pt circular profile avatar, center placeholder 'Search here' in Google Sans 16pt w400 `#5F6368`, trailing 24pt microphone icon in `#5F6368`. Tap expands to full-screen search."
- "Build the Directions FAB: 56pt circle floating 16pt from trailing/bottom edges over the map, `#4285F4` background, 24pt white directional arrow web-accessible icon `arrow.triangle.turn.up.right.diamond.fill`. Shadow `rgba(0,0,0,0.2) 0 4px 12px`. Pressed: scale 0.95, background `#1A73E8`, visible feedback state."
- "Design the Your Location dot: 12pt solid `#4285F4` inner dot with 3pt white stroke ring, translucent `rgba(66,133,244,0.18)` accuracy circle 120pt radius around it with 1pt `rgba(66,133,244,0.4)` outline, 40pt heading cone triangle emanating outward from the dot when compass is active. Gentle pulse 1.0 → 1.15 → 1.0 over 1.8s."
- "Create a place bottom sheet: anchored to bottom, 3 detents (140pt / 380pt / near-full), 16pt top corner radius, `#FFFFFF` background, `rgba(0,0,0,0.12) 0 -4px 20px` shadow. 32×4pt `#DADCE0` grabber centered 8pt from top. Inside: 72pt photo thumbnail leading, place title 'Blue Bottle Coffee' in Google Sans 20pt w500, rating '4.5' + 4.5 gold stars in `#FBBC04` + '(2,345)' in Roboto 14pt, category 'Coffee shop · $$ · 1.2 mi', green 'Open now' pill. Action row: blue 44pt Directions pill + Save + Share + Call."
- "Build the navigation turn card: anchored at top below safe area with 16pt margins, `#4285F4` background, 16pt corner radius, shadow `rgba(0,0,0,0.2) 0 4px 16px`. Leading 48pt white turn arrow glyph, turn instruction 'Turn right onto Main St' in Google Sans 22pt w700 white, distance 'in 0.3 mi' in Roboto 14pt w400 white 70% opacity below. Smaller next-turn preview '32pt arrow + Then left onto Oak Ave' at 14pt below."
- "Design a category chip row: horizontal scroll directly below the search bar with 16pt leading inset and 8pt between chips. Each chip: 36pt tall pill with `#FFFFFF` background, 1pt `#DADCE0` border, 16pt colored category glyph leading, 'Restaurants' label in Google Sans 14pt w500 `#202124`, 14pt horizontal padding. Active state: background `#E8F0FE`, border `#4285F4`, text `#1967D2`."

### Iteration Guide
1. The map owns 60%+ of the viewport on every primary screen — UI is layered, never stacked below
2. Google Blue (`#4285F4`) is the operating accent — route, location dot, Directions FAB
3. Four pin colors, four jobs: Red default, Green saved, Blue home/work, Orange category
4. Google Sans for titles, Roboto for body and metadata; Roboto tabular numerals for all data
5. Bottom sheet has 16pt top corners with a visible 32×4pt `#DADCE0` grabber — the drag-to-expand contract
6. Float the search bar as a pill with a soft shadow; keep 16pt margins to the screen edges
7. Turn cards in nav mode use `#4285F4` background and 22pt bold white text — the only display moment
8. Location dot's accuracy halo is the trust signal — always render it with `rgba(66,133,244,0.18)` fill
9. Dark mode uses `#202124` canvas (not pure black) to match the dark map tile palette

## React/Web Adaptation

- Implement the mobile information architecture as responsive React/Web UI.
- Use familiar web-accessible icons with equivalent meaning; platform-exclusive symbol names are source evidence, not implementation requirements.
- Express tactile or native feedback as visible pressed, loading, success, error, or motion states when the browser cannot provide an equivalent API.
- Preserve minimum touch target, safe-area, compact-density, bottom-navigation, and gesture intent using web capabilities.

## Provenance and Evidence

- Source repository: https://github.com/meliwat/awesome-ios-design-md
- Upstream commit: 5d3aeca239caef3ea4080034eb22ab87cc77fa24
- License: MIT
- Observed facts: values explicitly present in the framework-neutral upstream DESIGN.md and README.
- Inferences: React/Web adaptations identified as adaptations, not upstream facts.

## Known Gaps

- Native haptic APIs, platform-exclusive icon glyphs, and unverified device-specific motion are not Axhub implementation requirements.
- Brand behavior may change after the pinned upstream revision; revalidation requires a new commit pin and review record.
