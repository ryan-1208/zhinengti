# Design System Inspiration of Slack (iOS)

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

Slack's iOS app is defined by a single unmistakable color: **Slack Aubergine** (`#4A154B`), the deep wine-purple of the default left sidebar. That aubergine is the app's visual anchor — it's the first thing you see when you open Slack on mobile (a screen-filling aubergine pane if the sidebar is open), and it's the color that distinguishes Slack from every other messaging app. The 2019 rebrand simplified Slack's earlier rainbow logo into a more restrained four-color pinwheel (yellow, pink, green, blue), but internally the aubergine remains the workspace's "home" color and is carried over into the brand's custom typography. Critically, workspaces can customize this sidebar color in Preferences — a fuchsia workspace, a blue workspace, a monochrome black workspace — so the aubergine is the *default*, not a hardcoded brand.

The content surfaces outside the sidebar are clean white (`#FFFFFF`) in light mode or a near-black canvas (`#1A1D21`) in dark mode, giving Slack a two-zone visual structure: the saturated workspace sidebar on one side, the neutral conversation canvas on the other. Channel names (`#design`, `#general`) appear in the sidebar in a muted lavender-white (`#CFC3CF`) with full-white on the active channel. Unread channels get the bold treatment — channel name shifts to `#FFFFFF` bold, and a small count badge (for direct mentions) appears in bright red (`#E01E5A`, another Slack signature hue).

Messages are typographic and chunky — Slack uses **Slack Lato** (a proprietary face that evolved from Lato → Larsseit → today's Slack Lato / "Slack Sans" custom cut). Usernames appear in bold 15pt just above the message body, with timestamp in 12pt muted gray beside them. Messages breathe — generous vertical padding between turns, and generous internal 16pt side padding. Emoji reactions appear as inline chips below the message with emoji + count + blue outline when the current user has reacted. Threaded replies live in a pane that slides in from the right (or takes over the full screen on iPhone) — threads are as important as the main channel in Slack's model.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Slack Aubergine (`#4A154B`) as the signature sidebar color — workspace-customizable
- Two-zone layout: saturated workspace sidebar + clean content canvas
- 4-color brand pinwheel (yellow, pink, green, blue) — appears in the Slack logo and Huddle banners, rarely in UI chrome
- Unread channels: bold white + optional red mention badge (`#E01E5A`)
- Emoji reactions as inline pill chips below every message — with count and the current user's reaction highlighted blue
- Threads slide in from the right — threads are first-class, not secondary
- Huddles banner — blue (`#1264A3`) top strip when an audio huddle is active
- Status with custom emoji — every user can set a 30-character status + emoji next to their name
- Bottom tab bar: Home, DMs, Activity, Later, Search (5 tabs; Home tab = channel list + DMs)
- Mention colors: @channel = green pill, @here = yellow pill, @you = red pill
- Slack Lato typography — friendly geometric, 400 / 700 weights
- Online presence: small green dot (`#007A5A`) on avatar bottom-right

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Primary (Sidebar Default / Brand Anchor)
- **Slack Aubergine** (`#4A154B`): Default sidebar background — the signature color.
- **Aubergine Dark** (`#3F0E40`): Pressed state, darker sidebar tints on hover rows.
- **Aubergine Channel Text** (`#CFC3CF`): Channel name color on aubergine sidebar (muted lavender-white).
- **Aubergine Active** (`#FFFFFF`): Active channel name in sidebar — full white.
- **Aubergine Active BG** (`#1164A3` or workspace-custom): The highlighted row when a channel is selected on the sidebar. Default is a blue accent (`#1164A3`).

### Slack 4-Color Logo Palette (Used in Logo + Some Chrome)
- **Logo Yellow** (`#ECB22E`): Logo pinwheel yellow — also used in Huddle call notice and "NEW" flags.
- **Logo Pink** (`#E01E5A`): Logo pinwheel pink — also used for mention badges and urgent states.
- **Logo Green** (`#2EB67D`): Logo pinwheel green — also used for online presence dot.
- **Logo Blue** (`#36C5F0`): Logo pinwheel blue — also used for link color on aubergine surfaces.

### Canvas & Surfaces (Light Content Area)
- **Canvas Light** (`#FFFFFF`): Main conversation canvas — channel body.
- **Surface Light** (`#F8F8F8`): Search result rows, hovered list items, input field backgrounds.
- **Pressed Light** (`#E6E6E6`): Pressed states, selected rows.
- **Divider Light** (`#DDDDDD`): Hairline separators.
- **Thread Pane Background** (`#FFFFFF`): Same as main canvas when open.

### Canvas & Surfaces (Dark Content Area)
- **Canvas Dark** (`#1A1D21`): Main conversation canvas on dark mode — charcoal-gray, not black.
- **Dark Surface 1** (`#222529`): Elevated rows, input backgrounds.
- **Dark Surface 2** (`#2C2D30`): Thread pane, sheet backgrounds.
- **Dark Divider** (`#35373B`): Hairline separators on dark.

### Text
- **Text Primary Light** (`#1D1C1D`): Primary message body, user names.
- **Text Secondary Light** (`#616061`): Timestamps, metadata, channel topic.
- **Text Tertiary Light** (`#868686`): Placeholder, disabled.
- **Text on Aubergine** (`#FFFFFF`): Active channel in sidebar, workspace name.
- **Text on Aubergine Secondary** (`#CFC3CF`): Inactive channel names.

### Dark Mode Text
- **Text Primary Dark** (`#D1D2D3`): Primary message body on dark.
- **Text Secondary Dark** (`#ABABAD`): Timestamps.
- **Text Tertiary Dark** (`#6C6D6E`): Placeholder.

### Semantic & Status
- **Online Presence Green** (`#007A5A`): Small green dot on avatar when user online (a darker, more saturated green than the logo green — intentional for dot legibility).
- **Mention Pink** (`#E01E5A`): Mention badge (red pill with white count next to channel name if user is @-mentioned in that channel).
- **Typing Indicator Blue** (`#1264A3`): "Alice is typing..." indicator color + Huddles header strip.
- **Link Blue** (`#1264A3`): Inline links in messages.
- **Urgent Red** (`#E01E5A`): Destructive actions, error toasts.
- **Success Green** (`#007A5A`): Send-success flash.
- **@Channel Green BG** (`#F5E3BE` light / `#4A3D0D` dark): Yellow-green pill background for `@channel` mentions inline.
- **@Here Yellow BG** (`#FEF9E7` light / `#4A420D` dark): Yellow pill for `@here`.
- **@You Red BG** (`#F9D5DB` light / `#5A2731` dark): Red pill for `@yourname` mentions.
- **Reaction Chip (you reacted)** outline `#1264A3` with `#E3F2FC` background light.

### Workspace Sidebar Custom Colors (Examples of Preset Themes)
Slack lets users pick alternate sidebar themes. Common ones include:
- **Aubergine** (default): `#4A154B` / active `#1164A3`
- **Monument**: `#2C2D30` (dark gray) / active `#481349`
- **Tangerine**: `#CA4400` (orange) / active `#6B140C`
- **Ochre**: `#8B6A05` (mustard) / active `#481349`

Workspace admins can set a custom hex, so any sidebar color is possible.

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family
- **Primary (2022+)**: `Slack Lato` (proprietary; formerly `Lato` → `Larsseit` → today's custom cut, also marketed as "Slack Sans"). A rounded geometric sans with warm curves, humanist apertures.
- **Code / Mono**: `Operator Mono` (for some code blocks) or `Menlo` / `SF Mono` on iOS.
- **Fallback Stack**: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'SF Pro Text', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`
- **Non-Latin**: Slack ships script-specific fallbacks — Noto family for CJK/Devanagari/Arabic/Hebrew.

### Hierarchy

| Role | Font | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Workspace Name (Sidebar header) | Slack Lato | 18pt | 700 | 1.2 | -0.2pt | Top of sidebar |
| Channel Name (Sidebar, active) | Slack Lato | 15pt | 700 | 1.3 | 0pt | White bold for active |
| Channel Name (Sidebar, default) | Slack Lato | 15pt | 400 | 1.3 | 0pt | Muted lavender-white |
| Channel Name (Sidebar, unread) | Slack Lato | 15pt | 700 | 1.3 | 0pt | Full white bold for unread |
| Channel Header Title | Slack Lato | 17pt | 700 | 1.2 | 0pt | `# design` at top of channel |

| Username (Message) | Slack Lato | 15pt | 700 | 1.3 | 0pt | Bold sender name at top of message turn |
| Timestamp | Slack Lato | 12pt | 400 | 1.2 | 0pt | Muted gray beside username |
| Message Body | Slack Lato | 15pt | 400 | 1.5 | 0pt | Main message text |
| Thread Count | Slack Lato | 13pt | 600 | 1.0 | 0pt | "5 replies, last reply 3h ago" |
| Reaction Count | Slack Lato | 12pt | 600 | 1.0 | 0pt | Number next to emoji on reaction chip |
| Mention Text | Slack Lato | 15pt | 700 | 1.5 | 0pt | `@sarah` bold blue |
| Button (Primary) | Slack Lato | 15pt | 700 | 1.0 | 0pt | Green "Create channel" etc. |
| Button (Secondary) | Slack Lato | 14pt | 600 | 1.0 | 0pt | Outline buttons |
| Code Inline | Menlo | 13pt | 400 | 1.4 | 0pt | Code in message |
| Tab Label | Slack Lato | 11pt | 600 | 1.0 | 0.1pt | Bottom tab labels |
| Meta / Small | Slack Lato | 11pt | 400 | 1.2 | 0pt | "Edited", "Sent from mobile" |
| Status (User) | Slack Lato | 13pt | 400 | 1.2 | 0pt | Emoji + 30-char status next to name |

### Principles
- **Two weights dominate**: 400 and 700 — Slack's type hierarchy is driven primarily by weight contrast, not size variation
- **Weight concentrated at 400 / 600 / 700**: Regular body, semibold for reactions/threads, bold for names/headings
- **Warm geometric feel**: Slack Lato has rounder terminals than pure grotesque — signals friendly, human tone
- **Uppercase only on a few UI labels**: "UNREADS", "MENTIONS & REACTIONS" section headers in sidebar — tracked 1.0pt
- **Dynamic Type first-class**: Body, message text, channel names scale; timestamps, reaction counts, tab labels fixed

### Distinctive Components

**Aubergine Sidebar**
The signature Slack component. Full-height left sidebar in `#4A154B` (or custom) with workspace header + channel list + DMs + apps. Swipe-right from anywhere in the app to open; swipe-left to close. Users who switch workspaces (shift down on the sidebar top) see a vertical strip of workspace icons to the left of the aubergine.

**Huddles Banner**
A blue (`#1264A3`) strip across the top of the channel when a huddle is active, showing participants and a Join button. Tap to join.

**Emoji Reaction Chip**
Below every message, a horizontal row of pill chips: emoji glyph + count. The chip you've reacted with has a blue outline (`#1264A3`). Tap to toggle your reaction; tap "+" to add a new reaction from the picker.

**Thread Indicator**
"5 replies, last reply 3h ago" link below a message with a thread — tap to open thread pane. Leading up to 3 avatars of repliers.

**Status with Emoji**
Next to a user's name in Slack (everywhere: sidebar, messages, mentions, profile), users can set a 30-character status + emoji — e.g., "🌴 On vacation until Mon" — that appears inline.

**Mention Pills (Inline)**
`@channel` (green), `@here` (yellow), `@you` (red) appear as colored pill backgrounds with bold text in the message body — bold and unmissable.

**Online Presence Dot**
A small 8pt green dot (`#007A5A`) on the bottom-right of a user's avatar when they're online. The avatar is a rounded square (4pt) — Slack's signature deviation from the chat-app circle.

**Saved Items ("Later" tab)**
Messages and items you've bookmarked — distinguished by a small bookmark icon on the message.

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 4pt
- Scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 56, 72
- Message vertical gap (same sender, consecutive): 4pt
- Message vertical gap (new sender): 12pt
- Sidebar row: 32pt, 4pt vertical padding
- Bottom tab: 56pt

### Grid & Container
- iPhone: full-width messages, 16pt horizontal inset
- iPad: split-view — sidebar (280pt) + channel (center ~500pt) + thread pane (right 380pt when open)
- Sidebar width: 280pt on iPhone (full-width when swiped open), 260pt on iPad

### Whitespace Philosophy
- **Dense messages, breathing rhythm**: messages from same sender collapse closer together (4pt gap); new sender gets 12pt top margin — creating conversational "turns"
- **Aubergine is confident**: sidebar uses full color, no whitespace margins — it's meant to feel "owned" by the workspace
- **Thread pane is breathing room**: threads get same padding as main channel — equal first-class status

### Border Radius Scale
- Square (0pt): Huddles banner, full-bleed media
- Subtle (4pt): Avatars (rounded square — Slack's signature), buttons, message attachment cards
- Standard (8pt): Search bar, input fields, settings rows
- Comfortable (12pt): Bottom sheets, modals
- Pill (500pt): Reaction chips, mention pills, tab active pill
- Circle (50%): Online presence dot

## 6. Depth & Elevation

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Flat (Level 0) | No shadow | Sidebar, messages, channel body |
| Subtle (Level 1) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.08) 0 1px 4px` | Attachment cards, link preview cards |
| Floating (Level 2) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.12) 0 4px 16px` | Reaction picker, emoji picker, mention autocomplete |
| Sheet (Level 3) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.16) 0 -4px 24px` | Bottom sheets (compose, channel picker, status) |
| Modal Overlay | `rgba(0,0,0,0.4)` | Dim behind sheets and dialogs |
| Thread Pane | 1pt left border `#DDDDDD` | Divider between channel and thread (no shadow) |

**Shadow Philosophy**: Slack is flat by design — most surfaces have no shadow. Shadows appear only on ephemeral UI (reaction picker, emoji picker, bottom sheets) where the "this is floating" signal matters. The thread pane uses a 1pt border instead of a shadow because it's a structural divider, not an overlay. On dark mode, shadow opacity is reduced and a subtle border is added as a secondary signal.

### Motion
- **Sidebar open/close**: edge-swipe drags 1:1; threshold 50% commits with spring 250ms damping 0.8 + visible feedback state
- **Message send**: send button shrinks briefly (scale 0.9 → 1.0 over 200ms) + text field clears + message "flies into" channel from bottom — scale 0.96 → 1.0 over 250ms
- **Reaction add**: emoji chip scales 0 → 1.1 → 1.0 spring 300ms + visible feedback state
- **Thread pane open**: slide-in from right 250ms ease-out
- **Huddle join**: fullscreen fade from current context + visible feedback state success + bell sound
- **Long-press message**: reaction picker + action menu appears with spring scale-in (250ms)
- **Typing indicator**: "Alice is typing..." text pulses opacity 1.0 ↔ 0.6 over 1.2s loop
- **Mention autocomplete**: dropdown appears below cursor with fade-in 150ms
- **Push to refresh**: standard iOS spinner (Slack doesn't customize)
- **Haptics**: soft on message send, light on reaction add, medium on huddle join, success on workspace switch

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Slack Aubergine (`#4A154B`) as the default sidebar color — it's the signature brand anchor
- Make sidebar color workspace-customizable (admin setting) — allow any hex
- Use rounded-square (4pt corner) avatars — NOT circles — Slack's distinct choice
- Surface reactions below every message as inline pill chips with emoji + count
- Show threads as first-class: "5 replies, last reply 3h ago" link + slide-in pane on tap
- Use mention pills inline — green `@channel`, yellow `@here`, red `@user`
- Use Slack Lato (or Lato fallback) at weights 400 / 600 / 700 only
- Place the Huddles banner at top of channel when active — blue `#1264A3`
- Support status + emoji next to every user name — 30-char status is part of the identity
- Green dot (`#007A5A`) on avatar bottom-right when online
- Make the thread pane full-screen on iPhone, side-pane on iPad

### Don't
- Don't use circle avatars — rounded-square (4pt) is Slack's signature
- Don't hardcode the sidebar color — it's workspace-customizable
- Don't use Slack aubergine anywhere except the sidebar (and login screens) — it's the sidebar's color
- Don't put mentions without the colored pill background — the pill IS the mention
- Don't ignore threads — they need a sliding pane, not a tap-through replacement of the main view
- Don't use Helvetica or SF Pro Display — Slack Lato's warmth is the voice
- Don't use Lato weights 300/500/900 — 400/600/700 only
- Don't animate reactions elaborately — a gentle spring scale is enough
- Don't use heavy shadows on messages — Slack is flat; shadows only on floating ephemeral UI
- Don't cram the channel name with decorations — leading `#` / `🔒` + name + bottom topic line is the canonical layout
- Don't mix @mention styles — each color is semantic and fixed

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Device Sizes
| Device | Width | Key Changes |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| iPhone SE (3rd gen) | 375pt | Sidebar at 80% width when open |
| iPhone 13/14/15 | 390pt | Standard layout |
| iPhone 15/16 Pro | 393pt | Dynamic Island accommodated in top nav |
| iPhone 15/16 Pro Max | 430pt | Larger avatar (40pt) and reaction row |
| iPad (portrait) | 768pt | 2-column: sidebar (260pt) + channel |
| iPad (landscape) | 1024pt+ | 3-column: sidebar + channel + thread pane (optional) |

### Dynamic Type
- Message body, usernames, channel names: full scale
- Timestamps, reaction counts, tab labels, small meta: FIXED (layout-sensitive)
- Username bold: scales
- Code inline: scales in monospace family

### Orientation
- iPhone: portrait-preferred; rotates for media + huddles
- Thread pane on iPhone = full takeover (rotates as main content)
- iPad: fully rotates with layout adapting

### Touch Targets
- Message row: full-width tap (opens thread or action sheet on long-press)
- Reaction chip: 28pt tall, 44pt effective hit
- Send button: 32pt square, 44pt hit
- Sidebar row: 32pt tall, full-row tap
- Tab bar: 24pt icon, 56pt effective

### Safe Area Handling
- Top: top nav respects safe area + Dynamic Island
- Bottom: tab bar + home indicator respected; composer rises above keyboard
- Sides: 16pt content inset on channel body; sidebar is edge-to-edge
- Huddle banner: sits directly under top nav, above channel scroll area

### Iteration Guide
1. Slack Aubergine (`#4A154B`) is the default sidebar — NOT the canvas, NOT the accent. Workspaces can customize.
2. Avatars are rounded-square (4pt radius), NOT circles — Slack's unmistakable choice
3. Canvas is white (`#FFFFFF`) / dark charcoal (`#1A1D21`) — NOT aubergine on the conversation area
4. Channel text on sidebar: muted `#CFC3CF` default, bold white for unread, bold white for active (with blue `#1164A3` row bg)
5. Reactions are inline pill chips with emoji + count — blue outline `#1264A3` when you've reacted
6. Threads are first-class: "5 replies" link opens a slide-in pane (full-screen on iPhone, side on iPad)
7. Mentions have colored pill backgrounds inline: green for @channel, yellow for @here, red for @user
8. Typography is Slack Lato at weights 400 / 600 / 700 — NO light, NO black
9. Huddles banner is blue `#1264A3` across the top of the channel when active — 4-color pinwheel icon
10. Online presence = 8pt `#007A5A` green dot on avatar bottom-right (not a ring, a dot)

## React/Web Adaptation

- Implement the mobile information architecture as responsive React/Web UI.
- Use familiar web-accessible icons with equivalent meaning; platform-exclusive symbol names are source evidence, not implementation requirements.
- Express tactile or native feedback as visible pressed, loading, success, error, or motion states when the browser cannot provide an equivalent API.
- Preserve minimum touch target, safe-area, compact-density, bottom-navigation, and gesture intent using web capabilities.

## Provenance and Evidence

- Source repository: https://github.com/meliwat/awesome-ios-design-md
- Upstream commit: 5d3aeca239caef3ea4080034eb22ab87cc77fa24
- License: MIT
- Observed facts: values explicitly present in the framework-neutral upstream DESIGN.md and README.
- Inferences: React/Web adaptations identified as adaptations, not upstream facts.

## Known Gaps

- Native haptic APIs, platform-exclusive icon glyphs, and unverified device-specific motion are not Axhub implementation requirements.
- Brand behavior may change after the pinned upstream revision; revalidation requires a new commit pin and review record.
